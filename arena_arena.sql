Think before you print.</h2>\r\n<p>Encourage your employees to value paper more highly and to really consider whether they need to print out a document. Print management software can help to educate and remind users of the impact (environmentally and finically) of the documents they are about to print.</p>\r\n<h2>2. Print on both sides of the paper.</h2>\r\n<p>Set all your printers to duplex (printing on both sides of the paper) as a default setting.</p>\r\n<h2>3. Reduce uncollected print jobs.&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<p>Independent research has found that uncollected and duplicated print jobs account for 15% of overall print volume.&nbsp; You can reduce uncollected print jobs by using &ldquo;pull&rdquo; and &ldquo;follow me&rdquo; printing.&nbsp; This requires people to go to the printer and enter a password to retrieve their printed pages.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>4. Review your paper usage.&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<p>Talk to your existing supplier and look at other suppliers to see if you can get a better deal on paper.&nbsp; Perhaps consider changing to a different brand and/or grade of paper, review how much you buy and how often.</p>\r\n<h2>5. Email your invoices.</h2>\r\n<p>This can be a good saver of both costs and paper, Arena saves around &pound;7K per year by emailing 65% of its invoices directly to clients.

Increasing numbers of you want to know what our environmental policy is, how we&rsquo;re working towards reducing our impact on the environment and, most importantly, how we can help you to do the same. For this reason we&rsquo;ve put together our top tips for <a href="../../../page/green-arena" target="_blank">getting greener with Arena</a>.</p>\r\n<p><br /><strong>1.&nbsp;Arena is accredited with ISO14001 which means our operations and the products we supply to you are environmentally friendly. </strong>Arena has a targeted sustainability policy and an environmental management system that is maintained to help us to reduce our waste and energy consumption. We consider the environmental impact of our entire operation from the green credentials of the suppliers and partners we work with to the fleet cars we drive, the packaging we use and how our waste is recycled or disposed of.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2.&nbsp;We operate a less paper office and our products and services make it possible for you to do the same.</strong> Our experts can look at your business and find ways to reduce your carbon footprint using a range of tools from electronic document management, to a more energy efficient mix of print and copy devices and software to reduce unnecessary print and copy jobs.</p>\r\n<p><strong>3.&nbsp;Arena supplies carbon neutral print and copy devices through the Toshiba Carbon Zero Scheme, to reduce your carbon footprint. </strong>This is achieved by assisting communities in the third world and the UK in reducing the environmental impact of their activities through green initiatives. An example is a project in Kenya where the supply of energy efficient stoves has reduced firewood consumption by 70%. Owning a Toshiba device associates your brand with this initiative and reduces your carbon footprint.</p>\r\n<p><strong>4.&nbsp;At Arena we take an active interest in the green initiatives of all of our partners in the understanding that our suppliers affect our own environmental impact. </strong>Ricoh recently demonstrated its environmental commitment by dedicating the whole of June to activities in support of the United Nations World Environment Day. The focus was upon conserving natural resources, reducing CO2 emissions, promoting biodiversity and encouraging behavioral change.</p>\r\n<p><strong>5.&nbsp;The products we supply are manufactured with the environment in mind. </strong>An example of this is Kyocera&rsquo;s EcoSys philosophy, which demands that products are designed according to sustainable, long-life, low waste principles. Minimal use of materials, recyclability, low energy consumption, standby modes after idle periods and limited emissions are all key considerations.</p>', '2011-07-11', 'iStock_000014064522Small.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 352497, '2014-12-11 17:39:42', '', '2011-07-12 09:21:19', '2014-12-11 17:39:42', 3, 3, 0, NULL, 1, 0, NULL, 'top-tips-getting-greener-with-arena'),

Less printed books mean less production print energy, resources and environmental impact.</p>\r\n<p>Increasingly, businesses are also seeing the need to operate with greater consideration for their green credentials. Print and copy devices are designed in a much more environmentally friendly way with reduced energy consumption, ozone and noise output. Managed print services and electronic document management enhance this green effort through helping to reduce the amount of paper documents circulating around a business.</p>\r\n<h2>A reflection of our increasingly busy lifestyles and our thirst for convenience?</h2>\r\n<p>Obviously, an ebook is infinitely more portable than a printed book and many of us now carry around a whole library of books on our gadgetry for reference on the move. Provided we are able to access information and documents in digital format, electronic devices enable us to get by without carrying paper documents and books around with us and this has obvious benefits.</p>\r\n<p>Remote working is also on the increase as businesses put technologies in place to allow their employees to access files and documents outside of the office via portable devices. Electronic document management takes this a step further by removing paper files from the office too, and introducing processes for sharing, processing and archiving documents electronically.</p>\r\n<h2>A lust for new technology and gadgets?</h2>\r\n<p><br />Shiny new devices such as a tablets, Kindles and smart phones have become cutting edge fashion accessories and status symbols aspired to by all generations. Carrying a book of paper pages perhaps seems increasingly &ldquo;old school&rdquo; and out-dated in the modern age.</p>\r\n<h2>An opportunity to save the pennies?</h2>\r\n<p>The recent reports don&rsquo;t necessarily reflect a consumer preference for ebooks but are possibly more to do with their price which does not bear print, production and distribution costs. More than 650,000 ebooks are available at Amazon where bestselling titles are priced as low as 49p.</p>\r\n<p><br />This can be translated to our working lives where businesses can make significant savings through implementing a robust document management system.</p>\r\n<h1><br />Join the Conversation</h1>\r\n<p>As &ldquo;The Document Expert&rdquo; Arena lives the dream of operating a less paper office so we know it works and we see the benefits daily (ask us for a visit if you don&rsquo;t believe us!)

Some key facts from the index are detailed below.</p>\r\n<h2>On average, 42% of all business critical documents are held in hard copy only</h2>\r\n<p><br />This creates bottlenecks and results in time consuming processes. For example delayed supplier payments due to the time required for managers to approve and return paper copies of invoices.</p>\r\n<h2>Out-dated and slow manual processes</h2>\r\n<p><br />The index highlights the prevalence of out-dated and slow manual processes which rely on paper documents and bear the associated risks of document damage, loss, misfiling and security breaches which directly impact client services.</p>\r\n<h2>Inadequate Security</h2>\r\n<p>Only <strong><span class="font_blue">22%</span></strong> of respondents confirmed that their organisations used fully automated workflow systems for their business critical documents and 1 in 12 businesses felt that confidential documents were not adequately protected.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h1>The Solution</h1>\r\n<p>Respondents said that their top priorities were to increase knowledge sharing, improve security and drive workforce effectiveness. Converting document to electronic format and indexing them in a good document management software package, such as Arena&rsquo;s own mstore, can help to reach these goals.</p>\r\n<h2>Increased knowledge sharing</h2>\r\n<p>Converting documents to electronic format and storing them in one central place makes them easy to retrieve and share.

We are helping to solve a host of challenges currently faced by organisations operating in the education sector. Many of these are transferrable to other businesses and sectors so we&rsquo;ve put together our <strong>5 top tips </strong>to help you on your way along the path to better efficiency.</p>\r\n<h2><br />1.&nbsp;Rationalise your print and copy devices</h2>\r\n<p><br />Our print audits often reveal a mixture of types and brands of printers and copiers in the businesses we assist. Inevitably this is accompanied by a varied stock of costly toner cartridges.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Look at the devices your business uses, where they are stationed and what they are used for. Costs can easily be cut by networking your most efficient devices and removing expensive and unnecessary printers.</li>\r\n<li>A multi function device can do the task of scanning, faxing, printing and copying to replace several single function machines.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>2.&nbsp;Review your consumable stock</h2>\r\n<p><br />Many schools keep a large stock of toner for a variety of devices. Consolidation of your devices simplifies your requirements for consumables such as toner.</p>\r\n<h2>3.&nbsp;Control your print and copy</h2>\r\n<p><br />Print and copy can consume as much as 3% of total annual revenue and often businesses lack awareness about how much is spent in this area. Intelligent software is easily installed to enable you to monitor, understand and control your output and costs.</p>\r\n<h2>4.&nbsp;Make the most of your storage space</h2>\r\n<p><br />Most new buildings for education are designed with minimal storage space and this is a problem for establishments moving from older facilities with large paper document archives and toner stocks.</p>\r\n<p>Many schools are combating this with our managed print service. This helps to reduce stocks of toner which is automatically delivered when devices run low.</p>\r\n<p>Converting documents to electronic format is also becoming popular as this frees-up storage space. A good document management system such as Arena&rsquo;s own mstore can help and delivers a host of other benefits.</p>\r\n<h2>5.&nbsp;Save time on printer maintenance</h2>\r\n<p><br />A review and reduction of your printers and copiers or a managed print service is often appreciated by IT teams who are responsible for managing toner stock and maintenance to keep devices running.</p>', '2011-09-07', 'iStock_000017453887Small_KidsScience.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 237976, '2014-12-11 17:43:58', '', '2011-08-26 11:53:15', '2014-12-11 17:43:58', 3, 3, 0, NULL, 1, 0, NULL, 'back-to-school-top-tips-for-document-management-in-education-and-beyond'),

Jaime Lockwood, IT manager, spoke to us about the positive outcome in terms of cost, fleet maintenance and environmental impact.</p>\r\n<p>Jaime told us: &ldquo;Originally there were two reasons we wanted to do this, the first was looking at cost savings and efficiencies. The second was our Green Policy.</p>\r\n<p>Even though we knew there would be a green impact to duplexing [printing on both side of the page] our printing, we were keen to see the overall effect on efficiencies. We know it&rsquo;s important to our clients that we use green, environmentally sustainable practices. Now thanks to Arena we are able to demonstrate the impact our green policy is making on the environment. Everyone wins.</p>\r\n<p>We knew the MPS proposal from Arena felt right and we have been delighted by the results it has generated for our business in the first year. The projected costs were impressive but it&rsquo;s only now that we can look at the evidence and see what we&rsquo;ve gained. This has been the right move for us as a firm, and we know that it will chime with our clients.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<h2>Greener with Arena<br /><span class="font_blue">6% Reduction in energy consumption</span></h2>\r\n<p>Morrish took on a fleet of brand new devices designed with the environment in mind. This means lower emissions of ozone, heat and noise.</p>\r\n<p>The new print and copy fleet at Morrish is set to duplex print (both sides of the paper) by default. Jaime says: &ldquo;Our paper consumption has dropped dramatically, which contributes to our sustainability goals. Providing facilities for our staff to scan and email documents on our new devices has also saved postage costs and processing time in our mail room, increasing our efficiency. Our clients do care about the environment and the world around them, so it helps us to be able to assure them that we walk the walk when it comes to being environmentally friendly.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<h2>Increased productivity: Consumables and maintenance<br /><span class="font_blue">27% reduction on consumable costs</span></h2>\r\n<p>Jaime used to spend a lot of time ordering consumables such as toner for the printer fleet and arranging to service broken machines. &ldquo;Arena takes care of all of this for us and everything is automated. When toner runs low we get a new supply without needing to even place an order and if we have a faulty machine an engineer often knocks on our door before we realise there&rsquo;s a problem. Because consumables are only ordered when needed, less space is taken up with stock and we&rsquo;re spending 27% less on toner and supplies.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<h2>Improved financial control and cost reduction<br /><span class="font_blue">26% reduction on print and copy costs</span></h2>\r\n<p>In addition to this, the firm now receives one transparent invoice each month covering all of its print and copy costs. Jaime comments; &ldquo;We can track our spending easily and we get no nasty surprises. New software allows us to track print and copy output and in terms of financial costs the Leeds branch of the business has seen a 26% reduction in costs over the last 12 months&rdquo;.</p>', '2011-09-07', '64__JFP7853.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 93221, '2011-08-26 12:13:40', '', '2011-08-26 11:58:25', '2014-10-08 11:56:26', 3, NULL, 0, NULL, 1, 0, NULL, 'the-positive-impact-of-managed-print-services-1-year-on-at-morrish-solicitors-llp'),

An average 10,000 daily sheets to 6,000 is not to be sniffed at so we''ve taken a look at the probable causes.', '<p class="introduction">A survey by Kyocera Mita has revealed a massive 40% drop in the number of pages printed by UK office workers over the last 12 months. This is the first time print volumes have fallen since the annual environmental survey started in 2007 and the reduction from an average 10,000 daily sheets to 6,000 is not to be sniffed at. We take a look at the probable causes.</p>\r\n<h2>1.&nbsp;Greater confidence in technology</h2>\r\n<p>The use of mobile technology is growing fast as manufacturers develop new types of devices with increasingly more sophisticated functionality. The average professional worker on the move will carry several devices with them that enable them to connect with the office, communicate via a plethora of media and share documents. As technology marches on and wins the trust of users, the need for printed documents decreases.<br />In addition, electronic document management software solves an array of business problems whilst keeping documents secure. Also, it reduces the need to print documents by making them easier to share and process and negates the need for storage facilities such as filing cabinets.</p>\r\n<h2>2.&nbsp;Improved print management</h2>\r\n<p><br />Tough economic times have forced many businesses to take a long, hard look at their costs with uncontrolled print and copy often proving to be a major burden. Software to track and minimise output is becoming an increasingly standard office commodity. This can deliver significant cost reduction, especially when implemented alongside more basic actions such as setting printers to use both sides of the paper when processing multi-page documents.</p>\r\n<h2>3.&nbsp;Reduced paper-based processes</h2>\r\n<p><br />Increasingly, software is available to enable traditionally paper-based processes to become automated so that they can be conducted entirely in electronic format. Even tasks such as approvals, which have traditionally required a signature on a paper document, are now being catered for with new technology.</p>\r\n<h2>4.&nbsp;Changing attitudes</h2>\r\n<p><br />A recent study by Lexmark showed that almost three out of four UK office workers are printing fewer emails than one year ago and over half are outputting less general business and marketing material. This suggests that it is becoming increasingly acceptable to share and store business documents in electronic format.</p>', '2011-12-20', 'iStock_000004581445Medium.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 205153, '2014-12-11 17:38:17', '', '2011-12-20 11:11:44', '2015-05-27 10:26:19', 3, 7, 0, NULL, 1, 0, NULL, 'uk-paperless-office-dreams-are-coming-true'),

(71, 'Shedding light on data protection –  our top tips', 'Failing to comply with the Data Protection Act can land your organisation with a hefty £500,000 fine - could you prove that you are in line with best practice?', '<p class="introduction">The annual cost of identity fraud to the UK economy is estimated at &pound;1.2bn and effects around 100,000 victims. Our top tips are some basic steps you can take towards&nbsp;best practice.</p>\r\n<h2>1.&nbsp;Get your files in order</h2>\r\n<p>The Data protection Act requires that any information or data that an organisation holds about individuals (such as personnel or client files, for example) is readily accessible. This relates to paper and electronic documents so if you have a large archive stored on paper, servers or disks you must be certain that it is well indexed so that you can navigate your way around it.</p>\r\n<h2>2.&nbsp;Think beyond paper</h2>\r\n<p>Consider how sensitive information is currently stored within your organisation. It is likely that you deal with a mixture of paper documents and electronic files. Paper can be difficult to manage securely in terms of tracking access, sharing or updates to documents so it is worthwhile taking the time to digitise sensitive and business critical files.</p>\r\n<p>A good electronic document management system can help you to organise your records and make them readily accessible whilst managing and monitoring access, updates and retention schedules.</p>\r\n<h2>3.&nbsp;Understand how data is used</h2>\r\n<p>Can you evidence the management of sensitive information within your organisation from creation through sharing and processing to timely and secure destruction or archiving? Create and maintain an audit trail by recording details on how records are stored, shared, accessed and updated.</p>\r\n<h2>4.&nbsp;Safety first</h2>\r\n<p>You need to be certain that your confidential data could never fall into the wrong hands. This can have dire consequences in terms of the law, your customers&rsquo; security and your organisation&rsquo;s reputation. Ensure that sensitive data can only be accessed by authorised people and that you have a record of how it is used.</p>\r\n<p>Paper can never be entirely removed and we would never expect the printers in your office to become obsolete. &lsquo;Follow me&rsquo; printing reduces the risk of confidential documents being printed at an unsupervised device.</p>\r\n<h2>5.&nbsp;Prepare for a crisis</h2>\r\n<p>Have you thought about the consequences of a fire or flood at your premises? How many files would be lost and how would this impact your business and your customers? In many cases a crisis could result in the loss of crucial documents, legal ramifications or even closure.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Data Protection Act states that systems should be put in place to guard against accidental damage or loss. Digitising your documents reduces this risk and may also remove a large document archive to free up valuable real estate.</p>\r\n<h2>6.&nbsp;Watch the clock</h2>\r\n<p>Disposing of information too soon, keeping it for too long or failing to provide evidence of secure disposal can all land an organisation in hot water with the Information Commissioner&rsquo;s Office.</p>\r\n<p>There are even guidelines on how finely paper is shredded and therefore it is wise to find out what will happen to your shredded documents. Recycling is an obvious &lsquo;green&rsquo; and safe option.</p>\r\n<h2>The 8 Data Protection Principles<img style="float: right;" src="../../../assets/articles/71/contained_images/c15757918304_112_FolderLocked.jpg?1327918818" border="0" alt="" hspace="0" width="113" height="162" /></h2>\r\n<p>1.&nbsp;Personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully</p>\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;Personal data shall be obtained only for one or more specified and lawful purposes, and shall not be further processed in any manner incompatible with that purpose or those purposes.</p>\r\n<p>3.&nbsp;Personal data shall be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose or purposes for which they are processed.</p>\r\n<p>4.&nbsp;Personal data shall be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date.</p>\r\n<p>5.&nbsp;Personal data processed for any purpose or purposes shall not be kept for longer than is necessary for that purpose or those purposes.</p>\r\n<p>6.&nbsp;Personal data shall be processed in accordance with the rights of data subjects under this Act.</p>\r\n<p>7.&nbsp;Appropriate technical and organisational measures shall be taken against unauthorised or unlawful processing of personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, personal data.</p>\r\n<p>8.&nbsp;Personal data shall not be transferred to a country or territory outside the European Economic Area unless that country or territory ensures an adequate level of protection for the rights and freedoms of data subjects in relation to the processing of personal data.</p>\r\n<h2>Find out more</h2>\r\n<p><a href="../../page/electronic-document-management" target="_blank">Arena''s mstore: software for electronic document management</a></p>\r\n<p><a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/for_organisations/data_protection/the_guide.aspx" target="_blank"> </a></p>\r\n<p><a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/for_organisations/data_protection/the_guide.aspx" target="_blank">Further advice from The Information Commissioner''s Office (ICO)</a></p>\r\n<p><a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/for_organisations/data_protection/the_guide.aspx" target="_blank"> </a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', '2012-01-09', 'legislation_ws.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 90546, '2014-12-11 17:36:33', '', '2012-01-30 10:18:14', '2014-12-11 17:36:33', 3, 3, 0, NULL, 1, 0, NULL, 'shedding-light-on-data-protection-–-our-top-tips');

Arena’s Neil Maude shares key points from the official response of the CBI and considers the potential impact on business.', '<p class="introduction">The European Commission has recently proposed new regulations designed to harmonise data protection rules across the EU. The Ministry of Justice has issued a &lsquo;call for evidence&rsquo; and in response the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has created a position paper based on comment from its members, including Arena. This asks the EC to reconsider the proposed legislation to avoid undue disadvantage to businesses.</p>\r\n<p class="indented">&ldquo;Data protection is an important duty for any business &ndash; your customers won&rsquo;t do business with you if they don&rsquo;t trust how you treat their data.&nbsp; Our comments to the CBI were based on our experiences of securing data and in helping companies with data discovery, so we were able to highlight issues around both intellectual property and the potential costs of compliance with the proposed legislation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class="indented"><strong><em>Neil Maude, General Manager of Arena Group</em></strong></p>\r\n<h2>The Proposal</h2>\r\n<p><br />The intention of the EC proposal is to bring together the diverse data protection legislation across its various member states, with the aim of creating a &lsquo;digital single market&rsquo; in Europe.&nbsp; With increasing business use of data and data portability there is a genuine need to clarify the legislation &ndash; even more so with the rise of &lsquo;Cloud&rsquo; computing.&nbsp; For example, it is quite possible for a UK to company to use 3rd party computing services located in another country and subject to non-UK legislation.&nbsp; This is compounded by user concerns regarding how their personal data might be used, as shown in media coverage of high-profile companies such as Facebook and Google.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The legislation attempts to resolve these issues, using concepts including the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A requirement for individuals to give <strong class="font_blue">explicit consent </strong>whenever their data is collected and used.</li>\r\n<li>Giving internet users a <strong><span class="font_blue">right to be forgotten </span></strong>when they would like their data to be deleted if they withdraw their consent and there are no legitimate grounds to retain it</li>\r\n<li>A right to <strong><span class="font_blue">data portability </span></strong>to obtain data from one organisation and move it to another </li>\r\n<li>A <strong><span class="font_blue">right to information </span></strong>which would ensure that individuals are fully informed about the way their information is handled</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The concern of the CBI is that the proposed legislation will actually cause more confusion in the mind of consumers and that businesses will incur excessive costs to comply.</p>\r\n<h2>What might this mean in practice?</h2>\r\n<p><br />The operational implications for businesses routinely using or retaining personal customer data could be significant and wide-ranging.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For example, the <strong><span class="font_blue">right to be forgotten </span></strong>rule could potentially require a company to trawl through all of its data archives to ensure that any relevant mention of that individual is erased.&nbsp; Arena&rsquo;s experience of legal discovery work - where the task is to locate all data related to a particular individual or case - shows that this can be a costly and time-consuming exercise.&nbsp; Potentially a company could be searching e-mail servers, file servers and even paper documents for any mention of an individual.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>However, the impact of the legislation could go far beyond immediate costs and the CBI paper includes examples of how the <strong><span class="font_blue">right to data portability </span></strong>could deter companies from innovation in data usage, if they know that a portability request would mean revealing their practices to competitors.</p>\r\n<p>Other elements of the proposal bring costly requirements for Data Protection Officers to be appointed, onerous disclosure timeframes and potentially crippling fines of up to 2% of company turnover.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It is not hard to imagine the impact if legislation, which may be entirely appropriate when applied to Facebook, becomes an obligation on all sizes and types of business.</p>\r\n<h2>Summary</h2>\r\n<p><br />The new legislation was first proposed in 2011 and is now at first reading stage in the European Parliament.&nbsp; The CBI is asking for a rethink of the proposal to allow for a more &lsquo;proportionate, risk-based approach&rsquo; and reduce the scope of the new regulations.&nbsp; The proposal is clearly going to be subject to significant debate.</p>\r\n<p>These moves highlight the current issues and public concerns surrounding the use of data by companies. Protection of individual data is clearly an essential requirement in the modern business environment and compliance with existing Data Protection Act legislation is mandatory. All businesses should consider the advice already available here.&nbsp; These principles are good practice as it is unlikely that regulations will be loosened in the future.</p>\r\n<h2>More information:</h2>\r\n<p><br />CBI Position Paper: <br /><a href="http://www.cbi.org.uk/media-centre/press-releases/2012/03/eu-data-protection-reforms-risk-strangling-innovation-cbi/">http://www.cbi.org.uk/media-centre/press-releases/2012/03/eu-data-protection-reforms-risk-strangling-innovation-cbi/</a></p>\r\n<p><br />European Commission proposal in full: <br /><a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/newsroom/data-protection/news/120125_en.htm">http://ec.europa.eu/justice/newsroom/data-protection/news/120125_en.htm</a></p>', '2012-03-05', 'legislation_ws.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 90546, '2014-12-11 17:35:20', '', '2012-03-30 14:07:57', '2014-12-11 17:36:09', 3, 3, 0, NULL, 0, 0, NULL, 'europe-calls-for-data-protection-act-changes-what-could-this-mean-for-british-businesses'),

Arena&rsquo;s software for electronic document management, <strong>m</strong>store, is used to manage pupil records and the school is getting on so well with it that plans are now underway to roll the system out to its finance and human resources teams too.</p>\r\n<h2>Creating a &lsquo;less paper office&rsquo; - Paper to pixels</h2>\r\n<p>Schools are legally required to keep specified document types for varying periods of time. Rules surrounding security of sensitive files mean that, if dealing with paper, filing and retrieval of documents can be very time consuming and archives can take up valuable storage space. These issues can be overcome by converting paper documents to electronic files and, as long as BS10008 is adhered to, those files retain the legal admissibility of their paper counterparts.</p>\r\n<p>Pastoral Administrator, Sarah Buglass, told us; &ldquo;the main reason we bought mstore was to make our documents more secure. We have to be really careful with safeguarding rules, managing who can access what and how long we keep documents for. mstore is much more secure than paper files locked in a room, it&rsquo;s quicker to find documents too and has made my job easier.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We had a special storage room for our paper pupil records. They were locked in cabinets and filed in alphabetical order - it could take a long time to find things. We have put all of those records into mstore and knocked down the wall where the storage room used to be which has given us lots more office space.</p>\r\n<h2>Security and audit trails</h2>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Only me and one other person can scan and index documents into the system and our admin manager is the only person who can delete documents. It&rsquo;s highly unlikely that we will lose a document once it&rsquo;s saved. Only a small number of authorised people can access documents so there is no chance of anyone wandering off with something they shouldn&rsquo;t have. The system also keeps a record of all activity so we know how and who is viewing, sharing and updating documents.</p>\r\n<h2>Document retention&nbsp;and crisis recovery</h2>\r\n<p>Whilst schools are legally obliged to keep some documents, they are also required to securely destroy them once the end of the retention period is reached.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;<strong>m</strong>store is set up to alert us when documents reach their retention deadlines so we can&rsquo;t keep them for longer than we&rsquo;re allowed to. This means we don&rsquo;t have to worry about archiving and shredding everything by hand and we have saved the time and cost associated with that. Our records would also be safe if we had a fire because they are all backed up on a server so we could recover them if we needed to.</p>\r\n<h2>Improved efficiency and productivity</h2>\r\n<p>Schools dealing with paper could have a mountain to climb in terms of finding all the relevant documents in preparation for an unexpected event such as a court case. A system such as mstore addresses this issue by linking documents by terms of common reference, and making them easily searchable.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Documents are easy and quick to find because we can search mstore using various terms like pupil names or document types. The task of scanning and indexing our archive into the system was fast and simple and now I take a new stack of documents to the scanner at the end of each day.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The training from Arena was really good and we&rsquo;ve only had a few problems with the system since it was installed. These were resolved on the same day we reported them and we&rsquo;ve had no bad service so we&rsquo;re really pleased. I&rsquo;d be happy to recommend Arena.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<h2>More information</h2>\r\n<p><a href="../../page/electronic-document-management" target="_blank">Arena''s <strong>m</strong>store: software for electronic document management</a></p>\r\n<p><a href="../../../case_studies">More case studies</a></p>', '2012-03-29', 'YHS_WS.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 93905, '2014-12-11 17:31:19', '', '2012-03-30 14:18:44', '2014-12-11 17:31:20', 3, 3, 0, NULL, 1, 0, NULL, 'york-high-school-on-document-security'),

We’ve set out a simple checklist of key pointers to help you ensure that you are getting the genuine article.', '<p class="introduction">There are so many different packages currently on the market under the guise of &lsquo;Managed Print Service&rsquo; (MPS) that making a purchase can be complex and fraught with risk. We&rsquo;ve set out a simple checklist of key pointers to help you ensure that you are getting the genuine article.</p>\r\n<h2>1.&nbsp;Clarify your current situation</h2>\r\n<p>A genuine managed print service provider will always carry out a print audit to assess how much output is coming from your current print/copy devices. This will include a cost and environmental impact assessment and will require a month&rsquo;s worth of data from your current machines.&nbsp; Expect a detailed report on your present situation and a proposed strategy to maintain or improve your costs, efficiencies and sustainability.</p>\r\n<p>A good MPS provider will propose a &lsquo;balanced deployment&rsquo; that considers your needs for document security, quality and convenience. Watch out for suppliers who show you a plan to consolidate all of your print and copy output through a small number of strategically placed devices. This will show you a dramatic cost reduction but is not necessarily the most beneficial set-up for you, especially if some of your staff will need to travel a long way to their nearest printer or if you are working with sensitive documents and need some desktop devices that can only be used by authorised employees.</p>\r\n<h2>2.&nbsp;Secrets in the software</h2>\r\n<p>Once you have implemented a managed print service you will never need to order toner again. Your devices will also be configured to alert your provider when a technical problem or routine service is needed. In theory, an engineer will call on you before you even know there is a problem.</p>\r\n<h2>3.&nbsp;Protect your balance sheet from nasty surprises</h2>\r\n<p>A major advantage of a managed print service is simplified billing. Over the course of a contractual period, lasting anything up to 6 years, expect one regular invoice (usually paid monthly) that combines all of your print/copy/imaging, servicing and toner costs into one, fixed price.</p>\r\n<h2>4.&nbsp;Be the boss and take control</h2>\r\n<p>An effective managed print service delivers devices integrated with <a href="../../../articles/112?tag=Expert+News" target="_blank">specialist software (often referred to as &lsquo;rules based&rsquo;)</a> that, at a basic level, monitors and reports on activity and output. At a more complex level it can feature default settings and user authentication technologies to control output and minimise waste.</p>\r\n<h2>5.&nbsp;Read the small print</h2>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a sad fact that some unethical print/copy providers are passing off second hand, refurbished devices and remanufactured toner cartridges as brand new. Make sure you get what you pay for. Also, understand what your provider will require of you should you decide to exit your service agreement before it matures as there may be a buy-out fee or other penalties.</p>\r\n<h2>Further information</h2>\r\n<p><a href="../../../articles/112?tag=Expert+News">Putting the brakes on wasteful print and copy</a></p>\r\n<p><a href="../../../page/print-the-hidden-costs">Print: The Hidden Costs</a></p>\r\n<p><a href="../../../articles/139?tag=Expert+News">INFOGRAHIC: Print control in pictures</a></p>\r\n<p><a href="../../../articles/130?tag=Expert+News">INFOGRAPHIC: The process behind Arena''s Managed Print Service</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', '2012-05-30', 'printersInHand_EDITED.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 172334, '2014-12-11 17:13:40', '', '2012-05-31 15:56:05', '2014-12-11 17:13:43', 3, 3, 0, NULL, 1, 0, NULL, '5-top-tips-for-selecting-a-managed-print-service-provider'),

There is never a need to rifle through mountains of paper and queries can be resolved on the first phone call. This makes us more productive, frees-up time to get on with other tasks and has improved our customer service. After six months original paper invoices are destroyed so we have a lot more space and no need for external storage.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<h2>New developments to date</h2>\r\n<p>Since the initial installation of mstore the system has been developed to manage the growing amount of paper received for processing.

We asked him to tell us all about it!', '<p class="introduction">Marcus Wallis, director of Arena''s Grantham site (also known as Fovia) recently undertook a mamouth climb to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro. We asked him to tell us all about it!</p>\r\n<h2>The team and the route</h2>\r\n<p>Marcus&nbsp;tackled the challenge with former Arena director <strong>Colin Grave</strong> and another good friend, <strong>Trevor Chapel.</strong>&nbsp;They were joined by 5 other climbers and a team of 37 guides and porters; "they&nbsp;astounded us with their tireless ability to scale the mountain very quickly whilst weighed down with kit and food."&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The group&nbsp;climbed the <strong>Lemosho trail</strong>, which is not the steepest and quickest but definitely the most strenuous walk&nbsp;Marcus has&nbsp;endured to date. &ndash; "Yorkshire&rsquo;s Three Peaks are nothing by comparison! The climb took us a total of 8 days with 6 nights under canvas on the route up, and 2 on our descent."</p>\r\n<h2>Challenging conditions</h2>\r\n<p>Being an avid and experienced fell walker and runner,&nbsp;Marcus is&nbsp;fairly fit, but Kilimanjaro was a real endurance test. "Our journey took us through 5 different climate zones, starting out with tropical equator heat around 30?C and rain forest terrain at the base of the mountain. Tundra came next, starting-out lush and green before getting sparser as we climbed higher. Finally, we were in ice deserts at high altitude where the weather is bitterly cold and temperatures dip way below 0?C. Evenings were particularly chilly so we wrapped up in loads of layers to keep warm!"&nbsp;The heroic porters had to carry masses of clothing and equipment to prepare&nbsp;the climbers&nbsp;for this dramatic variety of environments&nbsp;- "they&nbsp;still out-paced us and remained cheery throughout!"</p>\r\n<h2>Final push to the summit</h2>\r\n<p>The team reached base camp at <strong>16,000ft </strong>on the 6th day and waited until midnight to make a final push for the summit. Although&nbsp;they were taking advantage of calmer night-time weather on Kilimanjaro&rsquo;s peak, where conditions can be particularly erratic and dangerous,&nbsp;they set out in pitch black against a -10?C chill. Marcus says; "the climb was incredibly tough and steep but I&rsquo;ll never forget the feeling of pure exhilaration when I reached the peak to watch a beautiful sunrise, having fulfilled a massive personal goal."</p>\r\n<h2>Climbing for a cause</h2>\r\n<p>Thus far Marcus has raised <strong>&pound;1300</strong> for <a href="http://www.ambucopter.org.uk/" target="_blank">The Lincolnshire Air Ambulance</a> and <a href="http://www.willoughby.lincs.sch.uk/" target="_blank">The Willoughby School</a> in Bourne for severely handicapped children.

Our aims have always been to improve customer service, control information, reduce costs and ease compliance.

Here he provides his thoughts on how businesses  can prepare for the failure of key suppliers and infrastructure.</p>\r\n<h2>Background</h2>\r\n<p>In early 2012, Natwest, Royal Bank of Scotland and Ulster bank suffered a major crisis in the form of a technical crash that brought down cash machines across the country and prevented customers from accessing their accounts. Investec Securities banks analyst Ian Gordon estimated the final cost to the bank could be as much as &pound;100million, adding; &ldquo;This is one of the most widespread customer service &shy;failures we have had in recent memory.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<h2>What&rsquo;s the worst that could happen?</h2>\r\n<p>Not all businesses are so reliant on IT and many could continue without some part of their systems.&nbsp; But technology is there for a reason &ndash; efficiency, customer service etc &ndash; and in today&rsquo;s &ldquo;hypercompetitive&rdquo; marketplace it&rsquo;s a sure thing that if you don&rsquo;t look after your customers really well, then there&rsquo;s someone else ready to take that business.&nbsp; So it&rsquo;s a wise move to make sure that you have disaster recovery plans in place and consider what you&rsquo;re going to do when a key system fails. <br /><br />Further, we&rsquo;re now all working in an increasingly interconnected world, whether we like it or not.&nbsp; This brings a reliance on systems that are outside our control.&nbsp; The failure of NatWest systems doesn&rsquo;t just affect their customers &ndash; it affects who those customers trade with at other banks. <br /><br />Outside of the obvious payments issue, interconnectedness of systems is something to think about in terms of the resilience of your business.&nbsp; If some other part of your environment fails or is unavailable; e.g. power, phones and travel infrastructure &ndash; then what impact does this have?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s really worth considering these wider aspects of disaster recovery.</p>\r\n<h2>What to do when life gives you lemons &ndash; A simple 5 Step Business Continuity Plan</h2>\r\n<p><br />The examples above cover a wide range of woes which might affect a business &ndash; human errors, system failures, natural disasters and so on. Clearly, not all risks can be mitigated at a practical cost &ndash; some are acknowledged and accepted. However, you can do a great deal to plan ahead.&nbsp; The following are some simple steps that any business can take to cover the basics.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; <span class="font_blue">Nominate a senior manager to take ownership of business continuity and disaster planning.</span>&nbsp; This is not so you can point a finger at someone if it goes wrong &ndash; it&rsquo;s to make sure that the responsibility is clearly defined and that the issue has senior sponsorship</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; <span class="font_blue">Conduct a risk analysis</span> to look at the following things. Determine which are critical and which you can live without:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<h3>Systems:&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p>What IT do you have in place and what would you do without it?</p>\r\n<h3>People:&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p>Who are your key employees and for each, what would you do if that person didn&rsquo;t arrive for work tomorrow?</p>\r\n<h3>Processes:&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p>For each critical process undertaken by each business unit, where does it &lsquo;touch&rsquo; other organisations and what will you do if failure strikes?</p>\r\n<h3>Physical assets:</h3>\r\n<p>How would you cope without a particular building, piece of machinery, stock of paper records or other asset if you suffered a fire or flood, for example?</p>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; <span class="font_blue">Using the results of this analysis, write a disaster recovery plan</span> and publish it to the people who are likely to need it &ndash; the line managers in charge of each element.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; 4.&nbsp; <span class="font_blue">Consider your PR response to a public crisis</span>, what you will tell the media if they come knocking, who will be your spokesperson and do they need some specialist training?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; 5.&nbsp; <span class="font_blue">Test your plan</span> &ndash; at least once annually and whenever there is a sufficiently large change in the business to warrant a review.<br /><br />Whilst the pervasive nature of IT brings with it a whole range of issues when it doesn&rsquo;t work, technology also brings the tools to work around many problems.&nbsp; Data can be secured for guaranteed availability even if a primary location is damaged, and remote working can address access issues or bad weather, whilst robust processes should mitigate the risk of human error.</p>\r\n<h2>Where did Stephen Hester go wrong?</h2>\r\n<p>The worst still can happen and it&rsquo;s inconceivable that a bank regulated by the FSA, such as NatWest, won&rsquo;t have considered the points above and many more besides (given that they&rsquo;ve been able to open their branches on a Sunday to recover, I expect that they are already going through their prepared plans).&nbsp; To me, this just highlights the need for business continuity planning. <br /><br />This time it&rsquo;s Stephen Hester who&rsquo;s on the end of an unlucky break - next time it could be your business. Would you be ready to cope?</p>\r\n<h3>About Neil Maude</h3>\r\n<p><img src="../../assets/articles/113/contained_images/8d9e8419f6d7_180_NeilM_ws.jpg?1359557446" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" align="left" /></p>\r\n<p>Electronic Document Management General Manager<br />Tel: 0800 863 8000 | Email: <a href="mailto:neilM@arenagroup.net">neilM@arenagroup.net</a></p>\r\n<p>Neil joined the Arena Group in 2006 and has almost 20 years of   experience in the electronic document management industry, working with   both private and public sector customers.&nbsp; Neil sits on Arena&rsquo;s board  of  directors and manages the delivery operations of Arena&rsquo;s EDM  business.&nbsp;  His team spend their time developing software, implementing  solutions  for customers and providing after-sales software support  services, both  in the UK and internationally.</p>\r\n<h2>Related Features</h2>\r\n<p><a href="../../../articles/163">Confidential files left on trains, in the wrong hands, on the move?</a></p>\r\n<p><a href="../../../page/electronic-document-management" target="_blank"><strong>m</strong>store, software for document management</a></p>\r\n<p><a href="../../../case_studies?service=Electronic+Document+Management" target="_blank">Case studies: <strong>m</strong>store in practice</a></p>', '2012-07-02', 'Flood_ws.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 107622, '2014-12-11 15:42:35', '', '2012-07-19 10:27:32', '2014-12-11 15:42:35', 3, 3, 0, NULL, 1, 0, NULL, 'what-will-you-do-when-the-worst-happens'),

It&rsquo;s a fantastic place providing great opportunities for young  people between the ages of 11 and 18.

However, it also presents new challenges in taking care of your business critical documents, data, IT network and print output.', '<p class="introduction">Use of mobile devices in the workplace is on the increase, offering countless business benefits from improved efficiency to a fully provisioned mobile workforce. However, it presents challenges in taking care of your business critical documents, data, IT network and print output. Our Professional Services Manager, <strong>Ian Fox</strong>, gives us his insight.</p>\r\n<p>Mobile technology is advancing at lightning speed and the majority of people can now get their hands on a shiny new gadget at relatively low cost. Likewise, many businesses are investing in mobile devices for their employees to reduce their need to print whilst boosting productivity - providing tools to engage whenever, wherever. However, some new challenges are presented when it comes to managing business critical documents and data that are accessed or created on the move.</p>\r\n<p>So, how will you support workforce desire to use personal apps and devices while allowing them to be productive in a secure environment that protects your data? Here&rsquo;s my whistle-stop tour of tips for building your BYOD strategy.</p>\r\n<h2>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do we monitor BYOD on our network?</h2>\r\n<h5 class="indented"><span class="font_blue">37% of information workers are using technology before seeking formal permission</span> <sub><em>(Source: Forrester)</em></sub></h5>\r\n<p>You might have a policy that requires your employees to ask for permission before plugging any old device into your network but let&rsquo;s face it, they&rsquo;re doing it anyway. The better approach is to accept this and put technology in place to let you see exactly what&rsquo;s going on. Various software packages are available that can detect mobile access to your network and there is often a lot more going on than you would imagine. Dave Helm, Sales Director of <a href="http://www.bluelogic.co.uk/" target="_blank">Blue Logic</a>, agrees; &ldquo;With the right technology in place, no devices will sync with your systems without your IT department knowing about it. Just ensure you let your employees know that Big Brother is watching them!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<h2>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do we print from our mobile devices?</h2>\r\n<p>Are your employees creating documents on the move but then getting frustrated when they can&rsquo;t print them? Sometimes we just need ink on paper and you could be seeing some fairly imaginative workarounds including people putting their iPads on the photocopier glass to try and get a snapshot of the screen (just in case you were wondering, that doesn&rsquo;t work!) The most common thing we see is emailing of documents to network accessible inboxes where they can be printed to networked machines. This is time consuming and can be overcome using new technology. (<a href="../../../articles/mobile-printing-made-easier?tag=Expert+News" target="_blank">Check out our related article on mobile printing</a>.)</p>\r\n<h2>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can we control print output from mobile devices?</h2>\r\n<p>The next natural question! Enabling printing on your network from mobile devices can create another problem in that you may find that you can&rsquo;t monitor and manage output volume, colour usage, paper consumption, specific user activity and so on, like you can on your networked machines. Print control software can be configured to help you with this, controlling and reporting on activity from iOS and other mobile gadgets in just the same way as on your networked machines.</p>\r\n<h2>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can we manage data security on remote devices?</h2>\r\n<p>You may be concerned about employees accessing your business systems and data remotely, or even losing devices outside of the office. We&rsquo;ve all read chilling news stories about laptops left on trains and accidents do happen.</p>\r\n<p>Tools such as remote desktops can safeguard your intellectual property by ensuring that data remains on your server. Dave Helm comments; "As the corporate database grows, security of that data becomes increasingly important. Using Windows remote desktop can secure any data from being downloaded to local devices".</p>\r\n<p>In addition to this, electronic document management software can help by retaining files in digital format on your servers whilst monitoring what&rsquo;s happening to them and controlling user access.</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s still important to have strong password policies to prevent unauthorized users accessing your data and there are systems available that can remotely wipe mobile devices if they do get lost.</p>\r\n<h2>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally &hellip; Don&rsquo;t just ignore it!</h2>\r\n<p>My final tip is to embrace BYOD because it&rsquo;s happening regardless of your ability to manage it and it could be costing your organisation in terms of finance and efficiency. If you face it head on, get your strategy and systems in order and keep things simple then you simply can&rsquo;t go wrong!</p>\r\n<h3>About Ian Fox</h3>\r\n<p><img src="../../../assets/articles/106/contained_images/7ebde81a6a76_276_Ian Fox Jan15 large.jpg?1422352750" border="0" alt="" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="144" height="144" align="LEFT" />Professional Services Manager<br />Tel: 0800 863 8000 | Email: <a href="mailto:ianF@arenagroup.net">ianF@arenagroup.net</a></p>\r\n<p>Ian Fox joined the Arena Group as a Systems Engineer in 1995.

', 'For many households and businesses, inkjet cartridges are considered a necessary expense but research by consumer organisation Which? has found that they can be pricier than Dom Perignon champagne. Arena’s Group Sales Manager, Gary Putson, provides advice on steps you can take to get best value.', '<p class="introduction">For many households and businesses, inkjet cartridges are considered a necessary expense but research by consumer organisation <em>Which?</em> has found that they can be pricier than Dom Perignon champagne. Arena&rsquo;s Group Sales Manager, <strong>Gary Putson</strong>, provides advice on steps you can take to get best value.</p>\r\n<p>A replacement cartridge for an average inkjet printer costs &pound;45, far less than a bottle of Dom Perrignon champagne but drop for drop the ink becomes far more expensive. Inkjet printers are usually fairly cheap to purchase but this is where their appeal ends. A recent <em>Which?</em> report details the findings of an investigation that tested five inkjet printers from manufacturers including HP, Epson, Canon and Brother.</p>\r\n<h2>Paying for ink that never hits paper</h2>\r\n<p>The study found huge differences in the cost of printing 50 pages in one go, compared with printing the same number of pages over eight weeks. This is due to automatic cleaning between print runs. <br /><br />The report from <em>Which?</em> notes: &ldquo;Inkjet printers seem to have a fascination with keeping themselves clean. Switch one on, or finish printing some documents, and often a printer will initiate a cleaning cycle. This involves spitting ink into an ink absorber with the aim of keeping the ink nozzles in tip-top condition.&rdquo; <br /><br />Manufacturers insist that this is essential to maintain print quality but arguably, the waste is good news for them, as they place sizable profit margins on replacement cartridges.</p>\r\n<h2>What is the answer for home inkjet users?</h2>\r\n<p>If you must choose an inkjet printer then the simple solution is to shop around for a less wasteful model that uses low cost ink. It&rsquo;s worth comparing retailers and considering un-branded cartridges to save the pennies. <em>Which?</em> Is a good source of reviews to help you check-up on value for money.</p>\r\n<h2>Is there an inkjet printer in your office?</h2>\r\n<p>Take a look around and it&rsquo;s likely that you will spot at least one. Despite the growing number of businesses taking up managed print services and working with specialist providers to reduce and control the related costs, it is not uncommon for us to see inkjet printers creeping back onto the scene. This often happens when a senior manager wants a printer close by, when a printer breaks down or when a machine is needed on the desk of an employee who prints sensitive documents.</p>\r\n<h2>Only need one printer?</h2>\r\n<p>Even if you are a small business owner, opting for an inkjet printer is a waste of good champagne. Explore your options with a reliable provider so that you can agree on costs up-front, including regular servicing for peace of mind that your machine will remain in perfect working order.</p>\r\n<h2>What is the option for bigger businesses?</h2>\r\n<p>Businesses with multiple devices can engage a provider to assess their print and copy infrastructure &ndash; audited free of charge without obligation.

A Managed <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Document</span> Service delivers more</h3>\r\n<p>We are very confident that you can make significant savings through implementing Arena''s managed print service but this is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>\r\n<p>Several research studies have confirmed that <span class="font_blue">organisations spend between 5 and 15% of their annual revenues on producing, sharing, distributing, processing, storing and retrieving business critical documents and information</span>. Arena has proved that more substantial savings can be made through addressing the way you work with documents as a whole instead of looking at print and copy in isolation. For this reason it''s advisable to engage a managed document service provider.</p>\r\n<h2>Beware of &lsquo;consolidators&rsquo;</h2>\r\n<p>Any provider who simply proposes reducing the number of devices on your premises by pushing all of your output through a small number of multi-functional devices should set your alarm bells ringing. <br /><br />Your budget may be a high priority but it will not be your only requirement. A good provider will consider many factors including the types of documents you print, the nature of your business, your likely maintenance requirements and how you use documents across the board before they make a recommendation. They will look to balance deployment of your print and copy volume across the most appropriate hardware infrastructure to suit your needs. This is sometimes achieved through strategically placed MFDs but often combines them with desktop devices, print room equipment and software to help you manage output.</p>\r\n<h3>About Gary Putson</h3>\r\n<p><img src="../../..//assets/articles/107/contained_images/4c9a085c27a5_266_Gary Putson 0613.JPG?1404137254" border="0" alt="" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="108" height="148" align="LEFT" /></p>\r\n<p>Group Sales Director<br />Tel: 0800 863 8000 | Email: <a href="mailto:garyP@arenagroup.net">garyP@arenagroup.net</a></p>\r\n<p>Gary has worked with Arena for 11 years and has a long background in sales, originating in the telecoms sector.

(110, 'Questioning the Cost of Purchasing', 'Arena’s Neil Maude explains how to spot some commonly unrecognised and costly pitfalls in the way organisations source, purchase and pay for goods and services.', '<p><span class="introduction">Arena&rsquo;s Neil Maude explains how to spot some commonly unrecognised and costly pitfalls in the way organisations source, purchase and pay for goods and services.</span><br /><br />The tough economic climate has forced businesses of all sizes and types to identify savings. Sensible business leaders are taking a strategic approach, considering their processes and culture rather than implementing ad hoc cost-cutting campaigns that deliver little long term benefit to the bottom line.</p>\r\n<p>The process of sourcing, buying and paying for goods (commonly referred to as &lsquo;purchase-to-pay&rsquo; or &lsquo;P2P&rsquo;) is a good starting point. Often costly, onerous, paper-driven and lacking in transparency it can be difficult to control and use for informed decision making. Significant savings can often be made through combining a cost-conscious culture with an efficient P2P process that is supported by smart technology.</p>\r\n<p>Below I''ve explained a few warning signs that could reveal some, possibly unexpected, problems.</p>\r\n<h2>Authority</h2>\r\n<p>Reviewing and authorising expenditure before costs are committed is essential in making sure that money is not spent unnecessarily, incorrectly or even fraudulently. Whilst you do not want to burden your workforce with excessive controls over routine and low value purchasing, you do want to know that management has reviewed and approved high value items.</p>\r\n<h3>Tell-tale signs that your authorisation process is not robust enough:<br /><br /></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Invoices are received from suppliers without purchase order numbers or reference of authority</li>\r\n<li>Your finance team frequently needs to seek approval for items that are already purchased ("spent control")</li>\r\n<li>Managers are frequently surprised and unaware of items in the purchasing pipeline </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Conversely, beware of over-controlling your purchasing policy. Regulation is good but a straight jacket is bad!</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Transparency</h2>\r\n<p>Making sure that the right people have access to financial information is vital. Managers must be able to easily review committed costs to support budgeting, accountability and maintain healthy cashflow. This should not be restricted to last month&rsquo;s paid invoices but include pending (approved but not yet placed) and open purchase orders plus outstanding purchase requests. Providing your managers with a detailed picture helps them to make quick and informed financial decisions, keeps projects running to schedule and maintains productivity by placing data at their fingertips - giving you a real competitive advantage.</p>\r\n<h3>Tell-tale signs that financial information is not accessible enough for your management team:<br /><br /></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Behaviour:</strong> Look out for managers who often over spend; alternatively, those who seem over cautious and reticent about buying necessary resources to finish or start projects </li>\r\n<li><strong>Stalled projects:</strong> Often smaller items will have been purchased and the project will have started but problems arise when larger purchases cannot be afforded within the allocated budget</li>\r\n<li><strong>Management feedback:</strong> Finding out that managers are working on instinct, spending lots of time gathering data, guessing or roughly estimating their committed budget is a warning sign</li>\r\n<li><strong>What can you see?</strong> Can you access detailed information about your organisation&rsquo;s entire cost pipeline - beyond last month&rsquo;s financial statements?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Accounts Payable</h2>\r\n<p>Accounts payable is a key element in the P2P process but it is very dependent on the initial P2P steps - errors here can incur large costs. The crucial thing is to ensure your team can access sufficient information about what&rsquo;s been purchased in order to do to a good job when an invoice arrives.</p>\r\n<h3>Tell-tale signs that you need to review your accounts payable procedures:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Large numbers of invoices are received without purchase order numbers</strong>. Costly time is spent verifying details and seeking retrospective management approval</li>\r\n<li><strong>Your team is manually matching the details of hundreds of invoices to purchase orders</strong>. This is time consuming, repetitive (especially when working with paper) and prone to errors</li>\r\n<li><strong>You are frequently losing discounts for early payment of invoices</strong>. This could be due to slow processes, poor visibility of cashflow and a lack of management resources for forward planning</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>In conclusion</h2>\r\n<p>No matter how well controlled your P2P process is, it is worthwhile questioning its efficiency and related costs. How easy is it for your employees to buy the resources they need? How long is spent filing and retrieving documents, searching for information and validating invoices? How easily can your managers budget, plan, forecast and authorise spending? Are your purchasing controls being circumvented or is buying delegated because the process is too cumbersome? How much does a transaction cost your business? These are all worthwhile questions to ask and you may be surprised by what you find.</p>\r\n<h3>Top signs that your P2P process is costly and inefficient:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Reliance on paper or electronic forms that are not linked to a database: </strong>Does your finance team spend a lot of time chasing approvals and recreating, filing and retrieving paper documents?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Frustrated employees:</strong> Are employees struggling to get what they need to do their jobs productively or to find information for accurate budgeting?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Supplier enquiries:</strong> Do you receive high numbers of calls from suppliers about incorrect or late payments? </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Non-specialist purchasers: </strong>Are there people outside of your finance team who spend a disproportionate amount of time buying things for people?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Invoice volumes:</strong> How many invoices are received and processed each month by your accounts payable team? Could you reduce the average cost per invoice?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Payment lead times:</strong> Once an invoice is received, how long does it take to authorise? </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Asking these basic questions can result in multiple outcomes, and most organisations find areas for improvement. Armed with this understanding, the introduction of technology can simplify P2P and help you to nurture a culture where employees recognise and buy into the need to follow correct procedures.</p>\r\n<h2>Next steps</h2>\r\n<p>There are several software applications currently available that can help with addressing these challenges. On the market there are some very sophisticated and expensive systems that can cover stock control and supplier management (SAP and Oracle for example) in addition to more basic day-to-day purchasing processes. These are commonly used by businesses such as large retailers, manufacturers and distributors. At the other end of the spectrum we find organisations working with costly, inefficient and paper driven finance processes that lack the support of a document management system. Middle ground options, developed for non-stock purchasing organisations - in particular those in the service sector - are noticeably absent.</p>\r\n<p>For this reason, Arena has developed its own <strong>m</strong>store for Purchasing software to provide a straight-forward and cost-effective solution that is quick to implement for rapid returns in the form of efficiency, productivity, visibility and cost reduction.

I would bet that many readers will spot overflowing recycling bins and pages sitting uncollected on printers, forgotten or unwanted. Delve into those recycling bins and it&rsquo;s likely you would find documents printed several times in error, multi-page documents printed on one-sided pages (simplex). Perhaps webpages and emails printed in full, possibly in colour and over several pages including replies, Cc&rsquo;s and forwarded messages. There is also a frightening possibility that you might stumble upon a confidential document that was accidentally left on a printer and eventually binned (if indeed it remained in the building).</p>\r\n<p>The problem of uncontrolled printing raises various concerns;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The increasing cost of printing and paper places a heavy burden on budgets</li>\r\n<li>Activity within Arena&rsquo;s own customer base indicates that colour printing is on the rise, and this pushes up the cost of consumables</li>\r\n<li>Wasteful printing obviously has a negative environmental impact</li>\r\n<li>Sensitive documents printed on devices far away from the originating computer or device and/or subsequently forgotten about, pose a serious security risk.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>The right foundations for lower costs</h2>\r\n<p>Intelligent print management is becoming increasingly vital in addressing these issues and usually forms the foundation of a managed print service. Combining tools that monitor, archive and control output with the right mix of hardware, simplified maintenance, &ldquo;just in time&rdquo; toner supplies and transparent billing, will naturally push costs down. Not only this; a more print aware culture is nurtured, within which employees are far more considerate about what they print.</p>\r\n<p>Despite this evidence that print control delivers significant benefits, recent research from Quocirca suggests that adoption lags behind in the SMB market, where only 20% of businesses with 250-500 staff have centralised print management that can track output across all devices. Even more worryingly, 70% of respondents indicated that they had suffered at least one accidental data breach as a result of unsecured printing.</p>\r\n<p>With this in mind, I&rsquo;ve listed some of the features you might want to consider introducing to your print infrastructure if you have not done so already.</p>\r\n<h3>Rules-based printing:</h3>\r\n<p>Defaults can be applied based on job attributes such as colour, number of pages, single or double-sided (duplex) or the applications used to print from. For example, you may set a rule that defaults emails to print duplex and in black. Printing can then be directed to the most appropriate device in the network. This lets you control output from more expensive machines.</p>\r\n<h3>Secure pull printing:</h3>\r\n<p>Users send documents to a secure virtual &lsquo;queue&rsquo; and must go to a device (printer, MFD or other hardware) to access them. Authentication at the device is necessary to review documents in the queue; this can be managed using mechanisms including password login, PIN number, proximity card/fob or biometrics. Pull printing has obvious security benefits and ensures only required items are printed.</p>\r\n<h3>Quotas and permissions:</h3>\r\n<p>You may want to restrict certain functionality, colour printing or output from your most expensive devices for certain users. It is also possible to enforce quotas; this is increasingly done by education organisations to control student print volumes and manage budgets.</p>\r\n<h3>Cost recovery:</h3>\r\n<p>Consider whether you need to charge print, scan, copy and fax costs to internal users or teams. It is also possible to allocate costs to specific clients, divisions or cost centres. This is useful for businesses such as legal practices who charge individual clients and educational establishments that charge students.</p>\r\n<h3>Reporting:</h3>\r\n<p>It is possible to capture comprehensive information about overall activity on your network. Detailed reports enable analysis by user, device, server or client/cost centre.</p>\r\n<h3>Mobile printing:</h3>\r\n<p>Some print control applications enable you to send documents from mobile devices such as tablets and phones to the virtual print queue for release at a printer. Crucially, this output can be reported on in just the same way as activity from computers that are linked to your network. Read more about this in my recent <a href="../../../articles/106" target="_blank">BYOD article</a>.</p>\r\n<h2 class="introduction">It&rsquo;s impossible to manage what you cannot measure</h2>\r\n<p>Printing is here to stay, even though volumes may decline, so put the tools in place to let you proactively govern your print infrastructure. Print control provides cost transparency, improved document security and greener practices by ensuring that the right documents are printed by the right people at the right time.</p>\r\n<h3>About Ian Fox</h3>\r\n<p><img src="../../..//assets/articles/112/contained_images/a222e4929534_276_Ian Fox Jan15 large.jpg?1422352750" border="0" alt="" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="130" height="130" align="LEFT" />Professional Services Manager<br />Tel: 0800 863 8000 | Email: <a href="mailto:ianF@arenagroup.net">ianF@arenagroup.net</a></p>\r\n<p>Ian Fox joined the Arena Group as a Systems Engineer in 1995.

Clearly it is better to be proactive and prepared.</li>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<li><strong>Retention requirements</strong> - The amount of information being retained is ever growing, increasingly time-consuming and expensive to deal with.&nbsp; As well as cost, this might lead to problems with storage &ndash; especially for schools in a new building with limited space to store paper files.&nbsp; Academies may be required to retain even more records - those previously held by the LEA - creating another new problem.</li>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<li><strong>Continued improvement</strong> - There is an expectation of continual improvement in every organisation. Record keeping should be no exception.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>With these points in mind, the IRMS toolkit becomes a very useful framework within which to revise or refresh your procedures.</p>\r\n<h2>What is a record?</h2>\r\n<p>The IRMS defines a record as <em class="font_blue">"all those documents which facilitate the business carried out by the school and which are thereafter retained &hellip; to provide evidence of its transactions or activities.&nbsp; These records may be created or received, and then stored, in hard copy or electronically.&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n<p>This definition pretty much means that every item of data you create is a record &ndash; from formal typed documents to handwritten permission slips and every single e-mail.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a pretty daunting list. Clearly some records are more valuable than others and there are various pieces of legislation and guidance as to how long each record should be retained. All of which adds complexity.</p>\r\n<h2>Starting Point: Developing a formal Records Management Policy</h2>\r\n<p><img src="../../../assets/articles/113/contained_images/2b9f31c9bb0e_182_policy_image.jpg?1359558984" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" align="left" /></p>\r\n<p>The IRMS toolkit recommends starting with a formal written records management policy or code of practice that sets out the scope, responsibilities and links to other existing policies.</p>\r\n<p>This policy needs to be endorsed by senior management and readily available to staff at all levels. The document should provide a mandate for records and information management and a framework for supporting standards, procedures and guidelines.</p>\r\n<p>The precise contents of the policy should, as a minimum:<br /><br /></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Set out a commitment to create, keep and manage records which document the principal activities of the school</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Outline the role of records management, identifying and making appropriate connections to related policies, such as those dealing with email, information security and data protection</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Delegate roles and responsibilities for creating and using records appropriately</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Indicate how compliance with the policy and the supporting standards, procedures and guidelines will be monitored </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Outline how the policy will be reviewed and updated. This should be done at regular intervals and following any significant changes that may affect records management.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The toolkit includes a template which needs only the school name to be inserted and the document is then signed as a formal record of the school&rsquo;s commitment to its implementation.</p>\r\n<p>This is a good starting point because it clearly demonstrates and allocates responsibility. With the legislative implications, it&rsquo;s hardly surprising that the IRMS suggests that the one senior representative for the school (e.g. Head teacher) should take overall responsibility for implementing the policy.&nbsp; A second important point to note is that this person should also be responsible for providing guidance and promoting good practice.&nbsp; This is a little more contentious, as there is a time implication so it may be that this task is delegated and then audited.</p>\r\n<h2>Homework</h2>\r\n<p>Once this high level policy is in place, the next step is an information audit that looks at the information being held by the school. A sensible starting point for your information audit is to think about the types of information you hold, it may fall into categories, like these:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Current pupil records</li>\r\n<li>Former pupil records</li>\r\n<li>Finance records</li>\r\n<li>Human resources/staff records</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Considerations:</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Your classifications may be unique to your school, and you may be storing more or less information within each category. For example, an academy may have buildings and facilities management records to hold and these could be considered either a subset of Finance or an entirely separate category</li>\r\n<li>Each category will have its own set of retention rules, governing how long each type of document should be stored</li>\r\n<li>Each category should consider security &ndash; who needs to see particular information and who should not. This is a big topic and will be considered in our next issue.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>A proper classification of information, with defined security and disposal timelines, introduces a number of rules-based &lsquo;housekeeping&rsquo; tasks and there are various ways in which you can handle these. An electronic document management system (EDMS) can easily automate the process and is well worth consideration. Retrieval of documents on a computer can take a matter of seconds, improving speed of access and responsiveness to enquiries and requests for information. Also, documents stored within a suitable EDMS (compliant with BSi standards for <a href="../../../page/edm-for-legal-and-professional-services">legal admissibility of electronic documents</a>) will allow the original paper to be destroyed &ndash; removing the need for large physical filing areas, better protecting your records and releasing physical space for other uses.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For these reasons, the IRMS toolkit can be viewed not only as a best practice guide for records management, but a route forward to electronic record keeping.</p>\r\n<h2>Coming Up in Issue #2 &hellip; Conducting an Information Audit</h2>\r\n<p>The Information Audit is a critical first step in reviewing and understanding the information you hold, the format you currently hold it in, how and why it should be used and who should have access to it.</p>\r\n<h3>About Neil Maude</h3>\r\n<p><img src="../../../assets/articles/113/contained_images/8d9e8419f6d7_180_NeilM_ws.jpg?1359557446" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" align="left" /></p>\r\n<p>Electronic Document Management General Manager<br />Tel: 0844 863 8000 | Email: <a href="mailto:neilM@arenagroup.net">neilM@arenagroup.net</a></p>\r\n<p>Neil joined the Arena Group in 2006 and has almost 20 years of experience in the electronic document management industry, working with both private and public sector customers.&nbsp; Neil sits on Arena&rsquo;s board of directors and manages the delivery operations of Arena&rsquo;s EDM business.&nbsp; His team spend their time developing software, implementing solutions for customers and providing after-sales software support services, both in the UK and internationally.</p>\r\n<h2>Further information</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href="http://www.irms.org.uk/resources/information-guides/199-rm-toolkit-for-school" target="_blank">Records Management Toolkit for Schools Version 4</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="../../page/electronic-document-management" target="_blank">Electronic document management software from Arena Group</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="../../case_studies?tag=Education" target="_blank">Case Studies: EDM in Education</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="../../../assets/stored_documents/original/63_Papers on Rec Mment Education 102013v1_WebsiteVersion.pdf" target="_blank">Complete compliance guide: records management in schools</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Other papers in this series:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href="../../../articles/120" target="_blank">#2: Conducting a 5 step information audit</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="../../../articles/131" target="_blank">#3: Information access and security</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="../../../articles/136">#4: Information disposal</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="../../../articles/147?tag=Expert+News">#5: Email management</a></li>\r\n<a href="../../../articles/150">\r\n<li>#6: Risk and disaster recovery</li>\r\n</a> \r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n</ul>', '2013-01-07', 'school_WS.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 72801, '2014-12-11 15:11:07', '', '2013-01-30 14:41:57', '2014-12-11 15:11:08', 3, 3, 0, NULL, 1, 0, NULL, 'records-management-in-schools-1-developing-a-records-management-policy');

It’s a bold statement and particularly topical in this economy – Arena''s Neil Maude gives us his top tips on taking the paper out of your office.', '<p class="introduction">Arena''s Neil Maude gives us his top tips on taking the paper out of your office.</p>\r\n<p>Going paperless &ldquo;would save NHS billions&rdquo; &hellip;. so says Jeremy Hunt. This was so bold a statement that I started getting phone calls as early as 7:30am that morning.&nbsp; Hardly surprising, given that we provide consultancy to NHS Trusts on how to deploy a range of solutions and some of our electronic document management (EDM) solutions have been in place in NHS Trusts since 1998.</p>\r\n<h1><br />So, it&rsquo;s a hot topic. Everyone wants to know if it&rsquo;s possible, and whether going paperless is really the answer to running a more sustainable business.</h1>\r\n<p>Over the last 15 years, we&rsquo;ve seen the good, the bad and the plain ugly of deploying EDM solutions to organisations of the scale of an NHS Trust and we&rsquo;ve learnt a lot. Turning a business into a more sustainable operation (for whatever reason, be it to create savings or to live brand values) is a huge challenge and requires a substantial culture shift.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The trigger for the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-21033984" target="_blank">BBC headline</a> was on the publication of a PwC report and a ministerial speech by Jeremy Hunt, recommending &lsquo;better use of technology in patient care&rsquo;.&nbsp; Just to set right an initial confusion, much of the &pound;9Bn+ proposed savings are linked to better use of data systems and not just &ldquo;going paperless&rdquo;.&nbsp; This is an important point to make. The two are naturally connected and there is no magic formula to just &lsquo;going paperless&rsquo; &ndash; there&rsquo;s a quite complex process required to make this actually work. The huge savings figure actually covers a broad spread of efficiency gains &ndash; mainly from information sharing between different components of the NHS but also in patient self-service (access your own data, make choices, report on outcomes) and reduction in areas of risk/liabilities.&nbsp; The actual &ldquo;paperless&rdquo; bit &ndash; which I read as &ldquo;removing a large chunk of paper filing and providing that information to be used electronically&rdquo; - is based on a number of case studies and anticipated results.</p>\r\n<p>What struck me as very good in the PwC study was the inclusion of best practices from a wide group of organisations outside healthcare.&nbsp; There is also a detailed analysis of the challenges involved in this kind of organisational change &ndash; winning support, nurturing the &lsquo;early adopters&rsquo; and measuring the benefits.&nbsp; This again is fitting for organisations in all sectors and there are many useful insights here.</p>\r\n<p>Clearly, the report is talking about a very large piece of work&nbsp; but leaving aside the peculiar challenges which come from that scale, these challenges mirror those which we see time and again in organisations big and small.&nbsp; And whilst the NHS doesn&rsquo;t have the best track record of IT implementation, the &ldquo;on the ground&rdquo; problems of system implementation are little different to those encountered elsewhere.</p>\r\n<h1>Understanding how to make our businesses more sustainable, more productive and more efficient is a challenge many of us face. It is not an overnight transition but there are some simple steps which can often get you started on the right tracks.</h1>\r\n<h2>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Get end users involved early, or they will not come along for the ride</h2>\r\n<p>Ideally in the decision making and how the system will be used.&nbsp; It sounds obvious, but even just a few end users who will &lsquo;champion&rsquo; the system can make all the difference.&nbsp; With any process change there will be a learning period and your users should want the system to be a success rather than a failure.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be pragmatic</h2>\r\n<p>paper is still the best tool for some jobs and overall &ldquo;usability&rdquo; is the aim of the system. Involving users will highlight some areas where 100% &ldquo;paperless&rdquo; just won&rsquo;t work.&nbsp; Sometimes a piece of paper is the best way to capture or share information &ndash; accept this and look at complimentary technologies to produce documents and capture the data from paper.&nbsp; This isn&rsquo;t failing to &ldquo;go paperless&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s just providing a solution which is fit-for-purpose!</p>\r\n<h2>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select key short-term goals to win support for the initiative</h2>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Pick the low hanging fruit&rdquo;.&nbsp; Having a particular team or business area&nbsp; lauding the benefits they&rsquo;ve had from document management will create interest from everyone else.&nbsp; Even if you want to have a &ldquo;big bang&rdquo; change, someone has to go first and this should be managed carefully.</p>\r\n<h2>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set realistic measurement parameters and make sure they are used to appraise progress against the plan</h2>\r\n<p>Ideally these measures should be quantitative &ndash; which can sometimes require a creative way to define &lsquo;softer&rsquo; benefits.&nbsp; There is nothing quite like a number to prove the benefit of the system.&nbsp; It&rsquo;ll also tell you how well your project is progressing.</p>\r\n<h2>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Get management buy-in across the organisation</h2>\r\n<p>This is important even in the areas who aren&rsquo;t going to be paperless straight away.&nbsp; Sharing a vision creates &ldquo;pull&rdquo; and energy &ndash; it also avoids pockets of naysayers.</p>\r\n<h2>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be aware that information is used for many purposes</h2>\r\n<p>As well as allowing for efficient retrieval, think about how information is created/collected/modified (forms, updates and extra notes added to existing pages).&nbsp; What are the appropriate tools for each situation and what technology is already in place?</p>\r\n<h2>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Think of who needs to see the information and where</h2>\r\n<p>Accessibility is vital to a successful implementation, without it you&rsquo;ll just have printouts. Ensure you are making it easy for those who need to, to access it otherwise you will have failed before you&rsquo;ve begun.</p>\r\n<h2>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flip side to accessibility is security</h2>\r\n<p>Make sure yours is upgraded. Paper can be lost, but electronic data can be lost (or stolen) in vast amounts and many board directors are nervous of this.&nbsp; So build in appropriate security from the start.</p>\r\n<h2>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Think about the structure of what you&rsquo;re storing</h2>\r\n<p>(A taxonomy, in the jargon). Consider what indexes are required to allow the information to be retrieved quickly &ndash; once you start storing information you will be locked into a structure which can be hard to change.</p>\r\n<h2>10.&nbsp; Consider the different ways that information comes into the organisation</h2>\r\n<p>(i.e paper, e-mail, electronic data). Aim to consolidate this to a single path based on purpose rather than managing by where it came from &ndash; this is the next step towards managing your processes as well as controlling your paper.</p>\r\n<p>These all seem obvious things to do but we&rsquo;ve seen plenty of examples where one or more has been missing &ndash; always to the detriment of the overall initiative.&nbsp; It is possible to reduce your paper usage in a large organisation, and improve your business processes at the same time &ndash; but only if you have a clear plan.<br />Taking these points on board, the NHS may have a better chance of realising those billions of pounds they have earmarked in savings&hellip;and other businesses of all shapes and sizes can also look forward to a &lsquo;greener&rsquo; 2013.</p>\r\n<h3><br />About Neil Maude</h3>\r\n<p><img src="../../assets/articles/113/contained_images/8d9e8419f6d7_180_NeilM_ws.jpg?1359557446" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" align="left" /></p>\r\n<p>Electronic Document Management General Manager<br />Tel: 0800 863 8000 | Email: <a href="mailto:neilM@arenagroup.net">neilM@arenagroup.net</a></p>\r\n<p>Neil joined the Arena Group in 2006 and has almost 20 years of experience in the electronic document management industry, working with both private and public sector customers.&nbsp; Neil sits on Arena&rsquo;s board of directors and manages the delivery operations of Arena&rsquo;s EDM business.&nbsp; His team spend their time developing software, implementing solutions for customers and providing after-sales software support services, both in the UK and internationally.</p>\r\n<h2>Further information</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href="../../page/electronic-document-management" target="_blank"></a><a href="../../page/electronic-document-management" target="_blank">Electronic document management from Arena Group</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="../../case_studies?service=Electronic+Document+Management" target="_blank">Case Studies: Clients using EDM</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-21033984" target="_blank">BBC News feature on this topic</a></li>\r\n</ul>', '2013-02-19', 'RecyclingBin_WS.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 103431, '2014-12-11 15:04:29', '', '2013-02-12 11:27:25', '2014-12-11 15:04:30', 3, 3, 0, NULL, 1, 0, NULL, 'is-paperless-the-answer-to-being-a-more-sustainable-business'),

(117, 'Records management and the BSF storage conundrum', 'BSF buildings take learning to a new height but sometimes neglect critical support functions and the paperwork they curate. Arena''s Lisa Butterworth explores the options for schools that need to manage the reduction of a large paper document archive.', '<p><span class="introduction">The spread of new academies across the country has brought with it an array of stunning new BSF buildings. Academy status also often bestows a qualified business manager to take control of budgets. However, with every possible learning resource granted to them, some new academies appear to be under-resourced when it comes to handling the legal requirements surrounding records management.</span><br /><br />The Building Schools for the Future (BSF) program is spreading, inspiring new buildings across the UK designed to maximise the sustainable education experience. Many boast the newest technology and usually academy status that shifts budgets and decision-making responsibility to senior management teams. It seems that almost every resource is dedicated to the learning environment and, looking from the outside in, it&rsquo;s difficult to see a down side.</p>\r\n<p>However, many of these multi-million pound facilities mirror the same design features: large atriums and expansive, minimally furnished communal spaces. This sometimes contrasts with a distinct absence of space for business support functions and critical documents that go hand-in-hand with renewed management responsibility.</p>\r\n<h2>The legal landscape</h2>\r\n<p><br />The Information Commissioner&rsquo;s Office is <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-19424197" target="_blank">ever-more strict regarding data breaches in education.</a> Schools are under the spotlight and feeling the pressure of increasingly stringent rules.<br /><br />It&rsquo;s a fact that schools are legally obliged to keep sensitive records, such as child protection files, locked away for access only by authorised staff (ie; a child protection officer) for the lifetime of the children concerned. With modern medicine moving on in leaps and bounds, we are talking about upwards of 90 years. Other documents must be retained for 7 years before they are securely destroyed &ndash; and keeping a file for too long can be just as troublesome as letting go too soon. <br /><br />Freedom of Information requests add a further headache in the form of short notice demands for records that may be buried in an archive of paper files. Add to this the requirement to audit who looks at documents, when and exactly what they do; and you are presented with a challenge to the scale of literally thousands upon thousands of pages. In SEN schools the issue is exploded with head teachers managing around 10 times the number of records held by a regular secondary school.</p>\r\n<h2>Ticking paper time bombs</h2>\r\n<p><br />With all of this to contend with, some head teachers are sitting in older buildings with vast paper archives stacked up in basements, offices and store rooms.</p>\r\n<p>It''s no surprise that almost every school - gifted academy status or not &ndash; is being forced to consider what to do with all of that paper. Landing a new BSF building that promises practically no storage space simply adds the pressure of a deadline. <br /><br />This issue is widespread but only seen in the press when a school falls foul of the regulations, having failed to produce files for a legal case, suffered a security breach or lost records in a crisis such as a fire.</p>\r\n<h1>So, what options are there?</h1>\r\n<h3>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Manage the paper in-house</h3>\r\n<p>This means taking on the associated risks of loss, damage and legal cases.</p>\r\n<h3>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; External storage</h3>\r\n<p>This can be expensive and problematic when it comes to data security and retrieval.</p>\r\n<h3>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Digitise your archive and paper-driven processes.</h3>\r\n<p>A good electronic document and records management system (or, EDRMS) and processes in place including a <a href="../../../articles/113" target="_blank">sound records management policy</a>, can retain the legal admissibility of your documents. You are also afforded greater control over security and you can shred the paper.</p>\r\n<p>Many schools are opting for the this third measure, scanning documents in-house to a central database. This is a step in the right direction but throwing every document into one central, un-structured, electronic space presents problems with security and retrieval. For this reason it''s wise to consider specialist software.</p>\r\n<h2>Whichever option you choose, there are some key considerations worth making;</h2>\r\n<h3>Security</h3>\r\n<p>Think about how you store your paper files and look for a software package that will replicate it. Remember, you must be able to evidence that sensitive documents are secure and accessible only to authorised personnel.</p>\r\n<h3>Audits</h3>\r\n<p>Make sure your system enables you to track who is accessing which data, when and why.</p>\r\n<h3>Retrieval</h3>\r\n<p>Consider how you want to search for documents once they are digitally stored.</p>\r\n<h3>Integration</h3>\r\n<p>A good EDRMS package will work with your existing software, including common databases such as SIMS, or function-specific software, like SAGE. Think carefully before replacing anything - it could be a lengthy and stressful task.</p>\r\n<h3>Experience and Support</h3>\r\n<p>Choose an established application that&rsquo;s made for schools, buy directly from the developer to ensure you get top notch support and always ask for references.</p>\r\n<h3>A phased approach</h3>\r\n<p>The task can appear daunting so most good EDRMS software providers will be happy to advise and help you to create a plan based around your needs.</p>\r\n<p>Breaking the task into chunks will make it easier to manage, so decide whether to tackle current or archive documents first and then consider which document types to start with. For example, you may begin by training your staff to digitise current student records whilst outsourcing the scanning of your paper archive to a specialist with the expertise and staff resources.</p>\r\n<h3>About Lisa Butterworth</h3>\r\n<p><img src="../../../assets/articles/117/contained_images/e8e4b79c673a_186_Photo_Dec2012.jpg?1361468993" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" align="left" /></p>\r\n<p>Marketing Manager<br />Tel: 0800 863 8000 | Email: <a href="mailto:neilM@arenagroup.net">LisaB@arenagroup.net</a> | Twitter: @MrsButterwth</p>\r\n<p>Lisa Butterworth is a Chartered Marketer  with over 10 years of B2B and B2C experience in sectors including  education, packaging and software.

The Sales Team has also been provided with a brand new, state-of-the-art showroom to showcase the latest technology in print and document management. Logistics Director, Harry Wells, comments; &ldquo;the open plan layout of the building will encourage greater collaborative working and the renewed facilities strongly position the business for continued expansion in the North West.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>As the business continues to expand in the North West, Arena&rsquo;s rapidly growing customer base was boosted this week with the addition of over 100 service contracts from long-established local business PGL Graphics Ltd.

Recruitment is also underway for several sales account managers to double the size of the business&rsquo;s Lancashire-based workforce.</p>\r\n<p>Arena is an award winning team spread across 6 UK sites and working with local clients including Bolton St Catherine&rsquo;s Academy, Manchester Rusk and &nbsp;AFG Law LLP, helping them to manage their print strategy and documents in a more efficient, less costly and greener way.</p>\r\n<p>The Group has an ambitious 5 year plan which sets targets of &pound;20million turnover and 7 UK sites to be reached by 2015.

(120, 'Records Management in Schools #2: Conducting an Information Audit', 'Information is generally accepted as a key asset in any organisation and should be managed with the same care as more tangible assets such as money, buildings and classroom equipment.  Effective information management is all about security and getting data to the right people at the right time.  The IRMS toolkit rightly states that an information audit is a key step to achieving these aims.', '<p class="introduction">The Information and Records Management Society (IRMS) curates a regularly updated &ldquo;Records Management Toolkit&rdquo; written specifically to assist UK public sector schools in their compliance with the Freedom of Information Act 2000. In a series of articles, Arena&rsquo;s Neil Maude looks at the practical application of the principles described in this toolkit, using Arena&rsquo;s 20+ years of experience in the provision of document management solutions within and outside of the education sector.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h1>Part 2: Conducting an Information Audit</h1>\r\n<p>Information is generally accepted to be a key asset in any organisation and should be managed with the same care as more tangible assets such as money, buildings and classroom equipment.&nbsp; Effective information management is all about keeping information secure and getting it to the right people at the right time.&nbsp; The IRMS toolkit rightly states that an information audit is a key step to achieving these aims.</p>\r\n<h2>What is an Information Audit?</h2>\r\n<p>Simply put, the information audit is a survey of the records being used and held by the organisation.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a structured process of finding out what you have, where it is kept and how it is used. The IRMS toolkit suggests a step-by-step process which encompasses the same principles that Arena has used extensively in both the education and wider public/commercial sectors.</p>\r\n<h2>Step one: Secure a senior sponsor</h2>\r\n<p>The audit process requires a lot of in-depth access to information and discussions with key staff so it&rsquo;s important to have good senior backing. Make sure you also clearly explain the purpose behind the audit process to those involved, so everyone understands the aim of the exercise.</p>\r\n<h2>Step two: Identify key personnel</h2>\r\n<p>The information audit begins with the assumption that records are created for a particular purpose. Therefore, the ideal starting point is an organisational diagram or similar chart, showing the key functions.&nbsp; From this, we can identify the key staff to interview with regard to what information assets they manage.&nbsp; The IRMS suggests that the survey work could be via interview or questionnaires &ndash; from experience I would strongly recommend the face-to-face approach, as the quality and detail of feedback is invariably much better.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Step three: Map your document pathways</h2>\r\n<p>Once key people are identified, work with them to make a list of records being created. It often helps to think of the work being done as a chain of actions &ndash; often the document will go to other areas of the business and it is important to capture this journey.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Step four: Ask pertinent and insightful questions</h2>\r\n<p>The IRMS toolkit contains an excellent checklist of questions to ask about each record type to cover areas such as key points of access, security and retention/disposal. Look out for the next features in this series which will explore these points in more detail.</p>\r\n<p>There are two additional key areas for consideration which can draw significant insight and additional benefit from the audit process, so it&rsquo;s well worth making to effort to include them in your agenda when you are speaking to your information curators:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Room for improvement:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The audit is an opportunity to identify potential process improvements.&nbsp; Although it will need to be handled sensitively, a certain amount of &ldquo;and why do you do it that way?&rdquo; analysis can be undertaken.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Continuity planning:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Another good question to ask is &ldquo;what if you lost all of the information of this type &ndash; maybe in a fire &ndash; how would this affect you and what would you have to do about it?&rdquo;&nbsp; This will help to determine the importance of records (operationally, if not legislatively) and give a head-start for disaster and risk-reduction planning.</p>\r\n<ol> </ol>\r\n<h2>Step five: Review, update, repeat &hellip;</h2>\r\n<p>Finally, the audit should be considered a snapshot in time.&nbsp; Like any other audit, there should be a clear plan as to how the findings will be refreshed and kept current.&nbsp; Any process changes arising from the audit should also be subject to a &lsquo;plan-do-check-act&rsquo; cycle of implementation and verification.</p>\r\n<p>A complete and comprehensive information audit also puts the organisation in a state of readiness to update, or indeed create, a meaningful records management policy &ndash; <a href="../../../articles/113">covered in part one of this series</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The information audit is an important early step to implementation of an electronic document management (EDM) solution.&nbsp; It is difficult to see any organisation achieving a successful records management policy without a complete and regularly updated information audit.</p>\r\n<h2>Homework</h2>\r\n<p>The next issue in this series looks at the rules surrounding the safeguarding and security of your documents and critical information. The following considerations are a good starting point:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>How you currently ensure that only authorised people have access to sensitive files, and how you would evidence this if asked to do so by the Information Commissioner&rsquo;s Office (ICO). </li>\r\n<li>The number and frequency of Freedom of Information Act requests you receive and how quickly and completely you are able to respond to them.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Coming Up in Issue #3 &hellip; Information access and security</h2>\r\n<p>Protection of information relating to children is clearly a key responsibility and it&rsquo;s an obligation that is shrouded in layers of legislation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It is tempting to think that locking away your information and restricting access is the best way forward but this can slow down day-to-day work.&nbsp; Some information &ndash; such as medical records &ndash; must be both quickly available, restricted only to those who need to see it and monitored in terms of who has accessed it, when and why.</p>\r\n<p>So, information access and security should be considered together and in balance. My next article will give you some practical advice to tackle this issue.</p>\r\n<h3>About Neil Maude</h3>\r\n<p><img src="../../../assets/articles/113/contained_images/8d9e8419f6d7_180_NeilM_ws.jpg?1359557446" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" align="left" /></p>\r\n<p>Electronic Document Management General Manager<br />Tel: 0844 863 8000 | Email: <a href="mailto:neilM@arenagroup.net">neilM@arenagroup.net</a></p>\r\n<p>Neil joined the Arena Group in 2006 and has almost 20 years of  experience in the electronic document management industry, working with  both private and public sector customers.&nbsp; Neil sits on Arena&rsquo;s board of  directors and manages the delivery operations of Arena&rsquo;s EDM business.&nbsp;  His team spend their time developing software, implementing solutions  for customers and providing after-sales software support services, both  in the UK and internationally.</p>\r\n<h2>Further information</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href="http://www.irms.org.uk/resources/information-guides/199-rm-toolkit-for-school" target="_blank">Records Management Toolkit for Schools Version 4 (IRMS)</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="../../page/electronic-document-management" target="_blank">Electronic document management software from Arena Group</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="../../case_studies?tag=Education" target="_blank">Case Studies: EDM in Education</a> </li>\r\n<li><a href="../../../assets/stored_documents/original/63_Papers on Rec Mment Education 102013v1_WebsiteVersion.pdf" target="_blank">Complete compliance guide: records management in schools</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Other papers in this series:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href="../../../articles/113?tag=Expert+News" target="_blank">#1: Creating a records management policy</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="../../../articles/131" target="_blank">#3: Information access and security</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="../../../articles/136">#4: Information disposal</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="../../../articles/147?tag=Expert+News">#5: Email management</a></li>\r\n<a href="../../../articles/150">\r\n<li>#6: Risk and disaster recovery</li>\r\n</a> \r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n</ul>', '2013-03-12', 'iStock_000002831046Small.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 257162, '2013-03-12 10:04:51', 'Clip Board Man', '2013-03-12 09:40:30', '2014-12-11 16:00:10', 3, 3, 0, NULL, 1, 0, NULL, 'records-management-in-schools-2-conducting-an-information-audit'),

The popular annual Arena Group York Mini and Junior Run is back for a fourth year &ndash; and this year will raise money for the children&rsquo;s ward at York Hospital which provides vital care for youngsters and support for their families.</p>\r\n<p>The Arena Group Mini and Junior Run is organised by Jane Tomlinson&rsquo;s Run For All and takes place annually in York and Leeds.&nbsp;&nbsp; Arena pays for every young runner to take part in the events, making the series one of the biggest FREE mass participation children&rsquo;s event of its kind in Yorkshire. <br /><br />Setting off on <strong>August 4th</strong> from York&rsquo;s Knavesmire, the event comprises two runs &ndash; a 1.5km course for 3 to 8-year-olds and a 2.5km route for 9 to 14-year olds &ndash; and is entirely FREE to enter for all youngsters. <br /><br />Children are simply asked to raise a small amount of money for a charity of their choice. This year they are encouraged to raise sponsorship for ward 17 &ndash; the children&rsquo;s ward &ndash; at York Hospital. <br /><br />Fundraisers at the hospital plan to spend the money specifically on replacing the ward&rsquo;s out-dated nurses&rsquo; station &ndash; the first point of call for distressed youngsters and their parents. The station dates back to the 1970s; it has not been refurbished since and is now in desperate need of replacement. <br /><br />Using money raised from the Arena Group York Mini and Junior Run, staff on the ward aim to revamp the station to create a new warm, welcoming environment for children and their families. Patients on the ward will be encouraged to have a say in how they want the new area to look. <br /><br />York Teaching Hospital Charity Fundraising Manager Lucy Lowthian said she hoped the improvements would help make an often very stressful hospital visit just that bit easier. <br /><br />Lucy said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re really thrilled to have been chosen as the beneficiary for this year&rsquo;s Arena Group York Mini and Junior Run. It&rsquo;s a great event and we&rsquo;re really happy to be a part of it.<br /><br />&ldquo;To be able to refurbish the nurses&rsquo; station would be fantastic. We really want to make it more child-friendly, just to be able to make things a tiny bit easier for our patients and their families. <br /><br />&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be asking the children for their input &ndash; we want it to be really appealing for them and to be quite striking and welcoming.<br /><br />&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve wanted to complete this project for quite some time but we have never had the funding before so it has always had to stay on the &lsquo;wish list&rsquo;.&rdquo;<br /><br />Arena''s Managing Director, Adrian Fitzpatrick, said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re really excited to be sponsoring the Arena Group York Mini and Junior Run for the fourth year running; our support allows every one of the hundreds of children involved to take part for free.<br /><br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fitting that, this year, they will be encouraged to raise sponsorship for the children&rsquo;s ward at York Hospital and will be helping make a very distressing time just that bit more bearable.<br /><br />&ldquo;We&rsquo;re really looking forward to race day &ndash; the smiles on the kids&rsquo; faces remind us exactly why we sponsor the event.&rdquo;<br /><br />Arena Group York Mini and Junior Run event lead Tristan Batley-Kyle said: &ldquo;The mini and junior run is a great way for youngsters to get involved in sport in a really fun and safe way.<br /><br />&ldquo;Seeing them all cross the finishing line is a really special experience.&nbsp; This year they will be supporting children in hospital, helping to make their ordeals just that little bit easier.&rdquo;<br /><br />Entries are now open for the Arena Group York Mini and Junior Runs on August 4th.

It is tempting to think that locking away your information and restricting access is the best way forward but this can slow down and frustrate day-to-day work. Neil Maude gives us his advice for schools on information access and security.', '<h1 class="introduction">The Information and Records Management Society (IRMS) curates a regularly updated &ldquo;Records Management Toolkit&rdquo; written specifically to assist UK public sector schools in their compliance with the Freedom of Information Act 2000. In a series of articles, Arena&rsquo;s Neil Maude looks at the practical application of the principles described in this toolkit, using Arena&rsquo;s 20+ years of experience in the provision of document management solutions within and outside of the education sector.</h1>\r\n<h1>Part 3: Information Access and Security</h1>\r\n<p>The protection of information relating to children is clearly a key responsibility and it is an obligation that is shrouded in layers of legislation. It is tempting to think that locking away your information and restricting access is the best way forward but this can slow down and frustrate day-to-day work. Some information, such as medical records, must be both quickly available and restricted only to those who need to see it; so information access and security should be considered together and in balance.</p>\r\n<h2>Two particular pieces of legal guidance to be aware of</h2>\r\n<p>The Freedom of Information Act states that schools must respond to requests for information pertaining to individual pupils in a timely fashion. Failure to meet FoIA requests can and does lead to action by the Information Commissioner&rsquo;s Office (ICO). Changes to Special Education Needs (SEN) legislation are expected to deliver increased numbers of requests.</p>\r\n<p>Compliance with BS10008 enables you to destroy paper files, whilst ensuring that the electronic copies remain legally admissible. Schools are required to produce a full audit trail to prove the veracity of their documentation. They must also implement a mechanism to prove that documents have not been tampered with and employ a retention policy.</p>\r\n<h2>Practical steps towards compliance</h2>\r\n<p><br />Having developed a records management policy and conducted an information audit you are in a good position to decide how to implement access controls for your documents.</p>\r\n<p>Compliance can be complex and problematic if you are working with scattered documents that are stored in several different ways. For example, you may have some paper child protection documents in a locked cabinet accessible only by your child protection officer. Other documents relating to the same pupil may be stored in your admin office or held in your SIMS database, computer files and applications (such as email inboxes) or digital storage devices. A sensible first step is to minimise variations in document formats and locations. A good <a href="../../../page/edm-for-education">electronic document management system</a> (EDMS) can assist this by bringing documents and storage systems together for access via one reference point.</p>\r\n<p>Whether you are working with paper or digital files &ndash; or a mix of both, there are some important legal compliance questions to address, these are explained below.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Storage</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4 class="indented"><span class="font_blue">"Pupil records should be kept securely at all times. Paper records should be kept in lockable storage areas with restricted access, and the contents should be secure within the file. Equally, electronic records should have appropriate security."</span> &ndash; IRMS Toolkit.</h4>\r\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> How do you store your records? How do you guarantee that they are never left unattended and seen by unauthorised people?</p>\r\n<p><strong>Paper: </strong>The IRMS suggests a clear desk policy involving the removal of physical records to locked storage facilities whilst they are not in use, whilst restricting access to offices where confidential files are being stored or worked on. It is likely that you will need to split records in order to store sensitive documents separately, for access only by authorised people.</p>\r\n<p><strong>EDMS: </strong>Allocate login details and access rights to individual users so that they can only access file types that they are authorised to see. For example, your child protection officer will be able to see sensitive records that a secretary working in your admin office will not be able to see. You can prevent sensitive documents from being shared, printed, deleted and/or over-written. Computer monitors can be set to switch to stand-by after a set period of inactivity, requiring the user to enter a password to re-activate the screen. This means documents left on-screen at unattended desks will be protected.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Completeness</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4 class="indented"><span class="font_blue">"A pupil or their nominated representative have the legal right to see their file at any point during their education and even until the record is destroyed. This is their right of subject access under the Data Protection Act 1998." </span> &ndash; IRMS Toolkit.</h4>\r\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> ICO judgements against schools falling foul of the FoIA have, to date, been largely for failure to comply with requests in a timely or complete fashion. If you were asked to provide a copy of every document you have ever stored on an individual pupil, how easily could you respond and could you be absolutely certain that you had a complete file with not a single document missing?<br /><strong></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Paper: </strong>With the ICO list in mind, the location of information is paramount.&nbsp; Physical filing can be a problem in that files can only be in the hands of one person at any one time, are often not replaced and are at risk of being lost. Your storage and archiving system is critical. The way you log where physical files are placed, and your strategies for avoiding filing errors, are fundamental to ensuring that you can rapidly bring together comprehensive information.</p>\r\n<p><strong>EDMS: </strong>Search facilities provide immediate and comprehensive access to documents that can be accessed via the system. This simplifies preparation for audits and FoIA requests whilst reducing the risk of missing information &ndash; providing the EDMS is a central document store.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Movement</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4 class="indented"><span class="font_blue">"Staff should be encouraged not to take personal data on staff or students out of the school.</span> &ndash; IRMS Toolkit.</h4>\r\n<p><strong>Question: </strong>Does paperwork ever leave your premises? If so, how do you keep it secure?</p>\r\n<p><strong>Paper: </strong>The IRMS guidance here is to check paper files out from a central system and log details of the borrower to create an audit trail. This does require an element of trust as you cannot control what happens to documents once they leave your building. There is also a risk of human error when it comes to logging - and document theft or loss outside of school.<br /><strong></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>EDMS: </strong>Data that is held on your servers may be accessed remotely, negating any need to ever transfer data onto a portable device such as a laptop. This mitigates several risks that arise from allowing documents to leave your premises &ndash; including theft, damage and loss.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Confidentiality</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4 class="indented"><span class="font_blue">"Access arrangements for pupil records should ensure that confidentiality is maintained, whilst equally enabling information to be shared lawfully and appropriately, and to be accessible for those authorised to see it.</span> &ndash; IRMS Toolkit.</h4>\r\n<p><strong>Question: </strong>How do you ensure that only authorised personnel can access confidential information? How do you monitor and evidence this? How quick and easy is the process?</p>\r\n<p><strong>Paper:</strong> Documents can only be held in one location, so ensure that only authorised people can access them using lockable storage. In addition, consider placing record sheets into sensitive files to log access information.</p>\r\n<p><strong>EDMS:</strong> In addition to the security functionality detailed above (logins and permissions), an EDMS system has the benefits of an audit trail of user activity.&nbsp; This allows the adoption of much more of a &lsquo;trusted&rsquo; approach to security, as well as being a key component of ensuring that your electronic records remain legally admissible. Unlike files saved on disks or similar media, an EDMS compliant with BS10008 allows you to use electronic documents as evidence. Clearly, you should only consider disposing of your paper records if your EDMS holds legally admissible information.</p>\r\n<p>Approaching access and security with a view to making information available quickly to those who need it is a great aid to both implementing the policies developed from your information audit and ensuring that you are well placed to cope with the demands of prevailing legislation.</p>\r\n<h2>Homework</h2>\r\n<p>Consider how you currently manage retention schedules. Look at how much time is spent archiving documents in order to isolate those that have reached their retention deadline and must be securely destroyed. Think about the measures you have in place to ensure that this is done accurately and comprehensively, without errors.</p>\r\n<h2>Coming Up in Issue #4 &hellip; Information Disposal</h2>\r\n<p>Schools are legally obliged to keep some types of records for in excess of 25 years. Other documents must be retained for shorter periods before they are securely destroyed. Just like failing to keep a record for long enough, retaining a document for too long can breach compliance regulations and disposal guidelines are equally important.&nbsp; My next article provides guidance to help you glide over various document retention hurdles.</p>\r\n<h3>About Neil Maude</h3>\r\n<p><img src="../../../assets/articles/113/contained_images/8d9e8419f6d7_180_NeilM_ws.jpg?1359557446" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" align="left" /></p>\r\n<p>Electronic Document Management General Manager<br />Tel: 0844 863 8000 | Email: <a href="mailto:neilM@arenagroup.net">neilM@arenagroup.net</a></p>\r\n<p>Neil joined the Arena Group in 2006 and has almost 20 years of  experience in the electronic document management industry, working with  both private and public sector customers.&nbsp; Neil sits on Arena&rsquo;s board of  directors and manages the delivery operations of Arena&rsquo;s EDM business.&nbsp;  His team spend their time developing software, implementing solutions  for customers and providing after-sales software support services, both  in the UK and internationally.</p>\r\n<h2>Further information</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/what_we_cover/taking_action/dp_pecr.aspx" target="_blank">ICO list: Prosecutions, penalties and formal undertakings</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6092125" target="_blank">Times Education Supplement: SEN-appeal parents keep legal aid</a>&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li><a href="http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6071806" target="_blank">Times Education Supplement: Parent power predicted to see surge in SEN appeals</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="http://www.irms.org.uk/resources/information-guides/199-rm-toolkit-for-school" target="_blank">IRMS Records Management Toolkit for Schools Version 4</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="../../../page/electronic-document-management" target="_blank">Electronic document management software from Arena Group</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="../../../case_studies?tag=Education" target="_blank">Case Studies: EDM in Education</a> </li>\r\n<li><a href="../../../assets/stored_documents/original/63_Papers on Rec Mment Education 102013v1_WebsiteVersion.pdf" target="_blank">Complete compliance guide: records management in schools</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Other papers in this series:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href="../../../articles/113?tag=Expert+News" target="_blank">#1: Creating a records management policy</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="../../../articles/120" target="_blank">#2: Conducting a 5 step information audit</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="../../../articles/136">#4: Information disposal</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="../../../articles/147?tag=Expert+News">#5: Email management</a></li>\r\n<a href="../../../articles/150">\r\n<li>#6: Risk and disaster recovery</li>\r\n</a> \r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n</ul>', '2013-04-08', 'iStock_000015150766Small.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 286274, '2013-05-08 09:54:11', 'Confidential', '2013-05-08 09:40:15', '2014-10-08 11:56:28', 3, NULL, 0, NULL, 1, 0, NULL, 'records-management-in-schools-3-information-access-and-security'),

(136, 'Records Management in Schools #4: Information Disposal', 'Neil Maude gives us his advice for schools on the disposal of information in line with current legislation. This feature is based on guidance from the regularly updated IRMS Records Management Toolkit; written specifically to assist UK public sector schools in their compliance with the Freedom of Information Act 2000.', '<p class="introduction">The Information and Records Management Society (IRMS) curates a regularly updated &ldquo;Records Management Toolkit&rdquo; written specifically to assist UK public sector schools in their compliance with the Freedom of Information Act 2000. In a series of articles, Arena&rsquo;s Neil Maude looks at the practical application of the principles described in this toolkit, using Arena&rsquo;s 20+ years of experience in the provision of document management solutions within and outside of the education sector.</p>\r\n<h1>Part 4: Information Disposal</h1>\r\n<p>Information stored by schools has a fairly fixed working life - but relevant data may be required to be held for a considerable period after a particular student has left the school.&nbsp; This can be for all sorts of purposes, including confirmation of attainment and a whole host of legal matters.&nbsp; Obviously, this means that there is a considerable storage burden which is borne by the final school which a given student has attended &ndash; a burden which may persist for many years, in some cases until the former student has reached 30 years of age.</p>\r\n<h2>What the law says</h2>\r\n<p>Two key pieces of legislation come into play with regard to the long term retention of student files (and any other information generated by the school).</p>\r\n<p>Firstly, there is the Data Protection Act (1998), one of the central principles of which is that: <em><span class="font_blue">&ldquo;Information shall not be kept longer than is necessary&rdquo;</span></em></p>\r\n<p>This is a clear call to dispose of information when it is no longer required.&nbsp; Indeed, roughly half of the IRMS Toolkit is an extensive list of how long to keep records of a particular type.</p>\r\n<p>The second relevant piece of legislation is the Freedom of Information Act (2000), which provisions for subject data access requests (SARs) by individuals who wish to see any and all personal information which may be held regarding them.</p>\r\n<p>When considered alongside the longer term storage requirement, these pieces of legislation create a complex picture for information retention and disposal.</p>\r\n<h2>Typical problems surrounding Information Retention and Disposal</h2>\r\n<p>There are obvious issues of space if paper documents are simply stored long term in a file room.&nbsp; It is likely that at some point you will run out of space or &ndash; as in the case of many new-build schools &ndash; there may simply be no space (Arena&rsquo;s Lisa Butterworth has written a separate piece on physical storage in BSF schools, which can be found via the links below).</p>\r\n<p>Regardless of space, simply placing documents in deep storage has 3 key problems:<br /><br />1) <span class="font_blue">Finding a given record</span> &ndash; in an increasingly cluttered store &ndash; is going to be a challenge that no-one wants to tackle. Certainly, this is unlikely to be done quickly and there may be some doubt about whether it could be done comprehensively in the event of a subject data access request (SAR).<br /><br />2) <span class="font_blue">By law, a school cannot retain documents beyond their set retention periods. </span>Older files will need to be removed at some point &ndash; even if this is by whole years of filing at a time. A store full of paper represents a future archiving challenge and there are costs for bulk destruction services.<br /><br />3) <span class="font_blue">Storing documents in this way is not legally compliant </span>with the Data Protection Act. A school adopting this approach will also be hard pressed to prove compliance with Freedom of Information requests. <br /><br />It&rsquo;s worth remembering that the same principles, problems and legislation apply to documents related to pupils, staff, governors and the financial management of the school. Whilst points 1 and 2 may be something that a school could live with, accepting the associated costs, point 3 is a major compliance issue that cannot be ignored.</p>\r\n<h2>Options for managing paper</h2>\r\n<p>A potential solution could be to periodically remove and destroy paper documents in the archive which are no-longer required under retention laws.&nbsp; However, faced with potentially thousands of files containing millions of pages, this is likely to be massively time consuming. <br /><br />For example, if it takes 5 minutes to retrieve a file and manually search through the contents for a particular type of document (a not unreasonable time for a 200+ page file) then repeating the process for a full year group of 500 students would take one person more than a week.&nbsp; This multiplies out for larger schools, manually archiving many years&rsquo; worth of files (remember - all kept until the former student is 25) and taking care to retain or remove file types with varying retention dates.<br /><br />Safeguarding must be a consideration if you choose to manually archive paper files. Sensitive files, for example those pertaining to child protection, must be handled only by authorised employees. (Read more about this in issue 3 of this series &ndash; link below).<br /><br />Also, manual sorting of numerous files can be fraught with human errors, so frequent rest breaks are advisable in the interest of refreshing tired eyes.</p>\r\n<h2>An alternative solution</h2>\r\n<p>Space issues can be addressed by scanning paper files and storing them electronically. Provided you have a system that enables compliance with BSi10008 (a standard and code of practice which ensures the evidential weight of documents stored electronically), you can destroy the original paper documents.<br /><br />A good electronic document management system (EDMS) will apply retention rules to each part of a classification of documents stored in the system. Documents are stored against the appropriate classification (eg; attendance, admission, parental permission forms, SEN statements). The system can then apply rules to dispose of documents or present them for review on a set date &ndash; possibly with reference to pupil specific information, such as date of birth.&nbsp; This approach dramatically reduces the management time associated with retention and completely eliminates the issues associated with large physical paper archives. <br /><br />It&rsquo;s important to note that simple scanning of documents into folders on the school&rsquo;s network, or other internal databases, does not provide adequate functionality to properly manage the retention and disposal of documents. This approach is not compliant with BSi10008 and is often fraught with problems relating to document retrieval and network capacity, making a specialist EDMS a much more practical solution.<br /><br />Of course, success also depends on an appropriate records management policy being enforced within the school, routine information audits (as explained in my previous articles) and matching the outcome of these audits to the retention guidance provided in the IRMS Toolkit. If all of this works as it should, the school can confidently place documents into an electronic store and destroy the original paper documents.</p>\r\n<h2>Things to consider</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<h3>Legal admissibility of electronic documents</h3>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Following the destruction of paper records, it is important that a school can rely on electronic information if called upon to provide evidence for a legal case.&nbsp; Assurance on this matter is provided by an EDMS that complies with the guidance in BSi10008, the code of practice for legal admissibility of documents stored electronically. This standard requires that the EDMS has sufficient auditing to demonstrate the provenance of a given document, including who created the document and when.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<h3>Freedom of Information (FoI)</h3>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In the event of a request under FoI, it may be necessary to evidence that a full and complete response has been provided to a subject data access request (SAR).&nbsp; For this reason, the IRMS Toolkit states that the school should maintain a list of records which have been destroyed and how this was authorised. Thereby, the school can protect itself from any allegation of failing to provide the requested information.&nbsp; A good EDMS will automate this.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<h3>Hardware and backup media disposal</h3>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>An EDMS will be part of data backup processes, typically meaning that copies of the system will be stored on magnetic backup tapes. For complete compliance, it is necessary that these tapes are subject to a destruction plan; otherwise the school may be retaining information unlawfully.<br /><br />Further, the school should consider disposal processes for obsolete computer equipment. The IRMS Toolkit suggests that hard drives should be &ldquo;dismantled and sanded&rdquo;, which is the ultimate way of ensuring that data cannot be recovered (in fact, Google crush and shred hard drives that are no-longer required).&nbsp; However, this does seem a little excessive and commercial software is available to over-write disks, ensuring that data cannot realistically be recovered from them, after which the disks can be recycled rather than sent to land-fill.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Evolution of the rules</h2>\r\n<p>One final point to note is that retention requirements are evolving. The IRMS toolkit was last updated in May 2012, but already we are seeing customers with emerging needs that post-date this document. This evolution is often stimulated by developments in technology and processes adopted by schools; for example, we recently worked with a school that needed a new document classification and retention rule for biometric data permission slips.</p>\r\n<h2>In Conclusion &hellip;</h2>\r\n<p>Whether you choose to work with paper or electronic files, it is essential to keep on top of the information retention and disposal issue as rules continue to change. A school is required to nominate someone to update its policies and processes in line with changing legislation. In the eyes of the law, the headteacher maintains overall responsibility for the records and information held. Installing an EDMS gives you the support and expertise of an external provider, and a practical, automated means to manage the increasing burden.</p>\r\n<h2>Homework</h2>\r\n<p>How does your school currently manage emails to ensure compliance with the rules and guidelines surrounding records management? What unique problems and challenges do emails present?</p>\r\n<h2>Coming up in Issue #5 &hellip; Email Management</h2>\r\n<p>An email is a formal record, just like any other piece of written communication and is therefore subject to the same obligations, duties of care, controls and legislation. However, emails tend to create their own unique issues when it comes to records management.

Neil Maude, General Manager of Arena’s electronic document management division looks at some of the trends, related issues and what you can do to mitigate your business risk.', '<p class="introduction">The amount of information created by organisations is growing at an ever increasing rate and shows no sign of abating.&nbsp; Meanwhile, legislation around information is becoming tougher and more likely to be enforced.&nbsp; Neil Maude, General Manager of Arena&rsquo;s electronic document management division looks at some of the trends, issues and what you can do to mitigate your business risk.</p>\r\n<h2>Documents and Data are on the rise</h2>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Once upon a time, records meant paper documents.&nbsp; They lived in filing cabinets&hellip;&rdquo;.&nbsp; So starts the introduction to a recent Association of Information and Image Management (AIIM) report on document retention practices.&nbsp; This report highlights that we are keeping more and more information, when actually we shouldn&rsquo;t be.</p>\r\n<p>HMRC rules state that we must keep financial records for the current tax year and preceding 6 years.&nbsp; For many organisations, this leads to an annual chucking out in April. As one year is closed off, the oldest goes in the shredder (I <em>hope</em> it doesn&rsquo;t just go in the bin!)&nbsp; This is as reasonably quick process as you know that the box marked, for instance, &ldquo;2009-10&rdquo; can be destroyed.</p>\r\n<p>However, what about documents that have different dates of retention within the same file?&nbsp; HR records are the classic example &ndash; you may have to keep pension records for a very long time, whilst you are <em>supposed</em> to remove disciplinary records quite quickly (retain only for 1 year).&nbsp; This is a much more onerous task &ndash; weeding out particular documents from some files and retaining others.&nbsp; It is easy to foresee that this painful task might be relegated for a &ldquo;rainy day&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Digital data: out of sight, out of mind</strong></h3>\r\n<p class="font_blue"><em>AIIM found that 29% of organisations are simply buying more disks in response to holding increasing amounts of data.&nbsp; </em></p>\r\n<p>The convenience of digitisation can make the problem worse, rather than better. As the AIIM report states, we used to be able to see the problem &ndash; simply running out of office space could be a compelling reason to do something about it.&nbsp; But digital information is somewhat out of sight and even when the disks get full, it&rsquo;s cheap to add more.&nbsp; In fact, the cost of disk storage space has been halving approximately every 14 months for the last 30 years<a href="#_edn1">[i]</a>. Clearly, e-mail and transactional records can be added to this digital data store, on top of the digitisation of paper records.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Your company data is predicted to grow at least 4-fold over the next 10 years</strong></h3>\r\n<p>But it seems likely that this situation will get worse.&nbsp; The annual IDC &ldquo;Digital Universe&rdquo; survey has been predicting 50x growth in global data storage in the period 2010-2020<a href="#_edn2">[ii]</a>.&nbsp; And whilst most of this is not related to business (consumer data, YouTube etc), that survey does highlight that 10% of this growth will be structured data and 80% will be related to some organisation or another &ndash; so your company data is predicted to grow at least 4-fold over the next 10 years.</p>\r\n<h3 class="font_blue"><strong>34% of the organisations surveyed had no process for information governance </strong><sup>(AIIM)</sup></h3>\r\n<p>These organisations are not only failing to control the growth of data storage - they&rsquo;re not classifying it or controlling security either.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>The tightening grip of the law</h2>\r\n<p>This deluge of data coincides with increasing levels of legislation and regulation.&nbsp; Increasingly, poor data governance and data &ldquo;leakage&rdquo; is being punished &ndash; particularly for organisations which fall under the jurisdiction of the Information Commissioner&rsquo;s Office.&nbsp; It is almost certain that the Data Protection Act will be strengthened by European legislation in the near future. Many industries also carry their own specific codes of practice and regulations, such as those laid down by the Financial Services Authority. Each of these pieces of legislation carries the potential for fines or even removal of the perpetrator&rsquo;s ability to continue trading.</p>\r\n<p>In particular, the Data Protection Act &ndash; as it exists currently &ndash; contains some clear guidance as to how long information should be held.&nbsp; One of the central points is that data about an individual should not be kept longer than the minimum time required for the processing of that data (i.e. the purpose for which it is held in the first place).&nbsp; In my opinion, this is an excellent starting place for information governance &ndash; if you don&rsquo;t need it, don&rsquo;t keep it.</p>\r\n<h2>Risky business</h2>\r\n<p>Besides the cost and the regulation aspect, why wouldn&rsquo;t you keep some information? It might come in useful someday, mightn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; And why does it need to be &ldquo;governed&rdquo;?</p>\r\n<p>Well, there are some risks around keeping everything forever:</p>\r\n<p><strong class="font_blue">If you don&rsquo;t have a decent structure for your data, you will waste time looking for what you think you might have.</strong>&nbsp; Locating a specific document can be painful if you don&rsquo;t have a good policy to govern where you should be able to find it. Add to that some doubt as to whether the document is there at all (ie; whether it actually exists) and it may be a total waste of time.&nbsp; As your data stores become bigger, this will get worse &ndash; so if you&rsquo;re not organising your data, you might as well not have it.</p>\r\n<p><strong class="font_blue">You might be legally compelled to find some information and that might be costly.</strong>&nbsp; For example, if you are defending a court case, you may be instructed to provide all the information related to a particular transaction or individual.&nbsp; If you have a &ldquo;digital landfill&rdquo; (an AIIM term for an unmanaged bucket of data) this could be very expensive to do &ndash; it may include searching all of your hard drives and even backup tapes in order to find comprehensive documents or to prove the non-existence of data.&nbsp; This might require external experts, who don&rsquo;t work cheaply.</p>\r\n<h2>Steps towards risk mitigation<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Implement a robust information governance policy and processes</strong>. If your processes are compliant with relevant legislation, then you know where your information is and you cannot be required to provide information which your procedures state you no longer have (ie; you can evidence the non-existence of the data).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Invest in technology. </strong>Implementing an electronic document management solution (EDMS), should allow you to classify information and to apply retention rules for different types of information.&nbsp; This can automate your processes for disposal of digital documents.&nbsp; Noting that AIIM research found that more than half of business documents were &ldquo;born digital&rdquo; (i.e. created on computer and then printed), this can be combined with a reduction in print costs (no more printing copies to file).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Consider e-mail. </strong>Tools are available to capture e-mails and subject them to automated classification and retention. This can be an entirely machine-driven process, taking place behind the scenes and independent of the storage of e-mails against the relevant business transactions &ndash; providing peace of mind without additional labour costs.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Look at what remains. </strong>Once the issues of documents and e-mails are resolved, then what remains is likely to be business transactional data (e.g. sales history in your accounts system).&nbsp; This data is likely to be quite minimal and also less likely to contain the most highly regulated &ldquo;personally identifiable&rdquo; information.&nbsp; So it&rsquo;s less of a problem.&nbsp; Depending on your industry you may also have specific data types to manage &ndash; such as phone recordings.&nbsp; But some of the main challenges will have been tamed by the actions above.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Get started now.</strong> If you are not already actively managing your information, chances are that you will have a large data set to tackle and, as we&rsquo;ve seen, it&rsquo;s getting bigger all the time. Unfortunately, retrospective classification of data is difficult and labour intensive. Automation (e.g. pattern based classification) can get you a part of the way, but chances are that you&rsquo;ll end up holding some of your existing data in a part of your system called &ldquo;archive&rdquo; &ndash; at some point you may be able to get rid of it, but only when you&rsquo;re sure that <em>all</em> of the different types of data stored there are no longer required.&nbsp; So the sooner you start, the less painful this problem becomes.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ol> </ol>\r\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\r\n<p>My late Grandfather &ndash; an engineer by profession, who lived through the &ldquo;make do and mend&rdquo; years following the great wars, had a clear rule regarding the items he kept in his workshop.&nbsp; &ldquo;Keep everything for 7 years.&nbsp; If it hasn&rsquo;t come in useful, just keep it for another 7&hellip;&rdquo;.&nbsp; This made him a very useful man to know if you needed a 3/8&rdquo; bolt for your lawnmower &ndash; if you could wait long enough for him to find just the right bolt.&nbsp; But it was his workshop and his bolts.&nbsp; Hoarding didn&rsquo;t create any problems, except an ever decreasing space to actually do any work.</p>\r\n<p>But hoarding information in this way isn&rsquo;t viable for a modern business.&nbsp; Even though the problem is out of sight, it&rsquo;s subject to laws and brings unexpected costs.&nbsp; Fortunately there are tools to solve these problems and the sooner you get started, the less it will cost.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>And you never know, being able to locate information quickly may pay back far more than the investment you make to keep it organised.&nbsp; After all, this is why we keep information in the first place.</p>\r\n<h3>About Neil Maude</h3>\r\n<p><img src="../../../assets/articles/113/contained_images/8d9e8419f6d7_180_NeilM_ws.jpg?1359557446" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" align="left" /></p>\r\n<p>Electronic Document Management General Manager<br />Tel: 0800 863 8000 | Email: <a href="mailto:neilM@arenagroup.net">neilM@arenagroup.net</a></p>\r\n<p>Neil joined the Arena Group in 2006 and has almost 20 years of  experience in the electronic document management industry, working with  both private and public sector customers.&nbsp; Neil sits on Arena&rsquo;s board of  directors and manages the delivery operations of Arena&rsquo;s <a href="../../../page/electronic-document-management">EDM business</a>.&nbsp;  His team spend their time developing software, implementing solutions  for customers and providing after-sales software support services, both  in the UK and internationally.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div><br /> \r\n<hr size="1" />\r\n<div>\r\n<h6><a href="#_ednref1">[i]</a> <a href="http://www.mkomo.com/cost-per-gigabyte">http://www.mkomo.com/cost-per-gigabyte</a> - disk space per unit cost doubles every 14 months.</h6>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h6><a href="#_ednref2">[ii]</a> <a href="http://www.emc.com/leadership/programs/digital-universe.htm">http://www.emc.com/leadership/programs/digital-universe.htm</a></h6>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>', '2013-05-31', 'iStock_000004287555Medium.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 507303, '2013-05-31 14:31:56', 'paper stacks', '2013-05-31 14:31:58', '2015-08-26 07:40:43', 3, 7, 0, NULL, 1, 0, NULL, 'data-hoarding-a-ticking-time-bomb-within-your-organisation'),

This set of components allows the fast processing of incoming documents, getting key information the right people in the shortest time.\r\nA recent upgrade has more than quadrupled the throughput capability of the most complex elements of this system, making the Arena product significantly faster than the competition.\r\n', '<p><span class="introduction">The mstore product suite contains a &ldquo;digital mailroom&rdquo;. This set of components allows the fast processing of incoming documents, getting key information the right people in the shortest time</span><br /><br />A recent upgrade has more than quadrupled the throughput capability of the most complex elements of this system, making the Arena product significantly faster than the competition.</p>\r\n<h2>What is digital mailroom?</h2>\r\n<p><br />A digital mailroom is a process of scanning incoming post and routing it onwards within an organisation. This replaces the traditional post-room functions of mail sorting and physical delivery.<br /><br />A digital mailroom process will consist of some or all of the following:<br /><br />1) Opening of the post and sorting for scanning: This may be done by bulk opening of mail and scanning via high-speed stack-fed scanners, or as an integrated process using specialist scanners which include mail opening devices.<br /><br />2) OCR: The captured images are passed through an optical character recognition process (OCR). This reads the content of each page and stores it as a searchable database (a &ldquo;full text index&rdquo;). This is fully automated.<br /><br />3) Classification: An additional stage of automated processing then interprets the content of documents according to business rules &ndash; extracting names, account codes etc. This &ldquo;classification&rdquo; process can incorporate lookups into other corporate data sources (e.g. customer databases) for validation and to allow rules-based decision making.<br /><br />4) Finally, the post item is released to a user or a business process &ndash; this could be the first stage of an <strong>m</strong>store workflow which routes particular types of work to the most relevant parts of the business.</p>\r\n<h2>Benefits of going digital</h2>\r\n<p>The digital mailroom brings several benefits over the traditional process &ndash; not only in improved speed of delivery but also in sending items to those best placed to take action. In addition, the OCR and subsequent stages can be used to consolidate incoming fax and e-mail documents into the same stream as incoming post.</p>\r\n<h2>Capture Plus speed upgrade</h2>\r\n<p>Whilst the OCR and subsequent stages are highly automated, system throughput is a key consideration. Modern scanning equipment will have scanning rates in excess of 200+ images per minute - even allowing for stop/start/refill operations found in real-world processes, we would expect to be producing 50+ images per minute. This means that typical OCR times of around 3 seconds per image (20 pages per minute) will create a bottleneck in the system, as the scanners produce images faster than the OCR &ldquo;engine&rdquo; can process them.<br /><br />Arena&rsquo;s new &ldquo;Capture Plus&rdquo; element can process at up to 90 images per minute<sup>[1]</sup>. This allows the OCR process &ndash; the most time-consuming stage in the mailroom process &ndash; to take place at speeds faster than the scanning input. This removes the processing bottleneck.<br /><br />Further, the Capture Plus engine is designed to allow parallel processing. In scenarios of large quantities of mail &ndash; which may include peak periods &ndash; multiple Capture Plus engines can be used to provide very high throughput capability, constrained only by the availability of computing resources.<br /><br />Finally, the Capture Plus engine can be used simply as a component of an <strong>m</strong>store electronic document management system (EDMS), even without the implementation of digital mailroom. In this scenario, the OCR process is used to provide a searchable index of all documents in the EDMS &ndash; helping to unlock the value of that organisational information.</p>\r\n<h2>Further information</h2>\r\n<p><a href="../../../page/electronic-document-management" target="_blank">More about mstore</a></p>\r\n<p><a href="../../../case_studies/15" target="_blank">Digital mailroom client: Leeds Building Society</a></p>\r\n<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: small;"> </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n<hr size="1" />\r\n<br /><span style="color: #000000; font-size: small;"> </span>\r\n<div>\r\n<h6><sup><a href="../../../javascripts/admin/tiny_mce/plugins/paste/pasteword.htm?1294418335#_ftnref1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[1]</span></span></a></sup><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup> </sup>Based on a sample of &gt;1000 images from a genuine customer scenario and on a representative hardware platform &ndash; also verified independently by customer testing.

Template configurations are created for specific screens in the third party application, allowing CFI to detect when the appropriate screen is displayed and where to locate the required information within that screen.

A special feature from Adrian Fitzpatrick, MD of Arena Group, featuring expert contributions Adam Kelly and Elliot Newall of www.thesportinmind.com', '<p class="introduction">A special feature by Adrian Fitzpatrick, MD of Arena Group, alongside Adam Kelly and Elliot Newall of www.thesportinmind.com</p>\r\n<h3>By Adrian Fitzpatrick, MD of Arena Group, alongside expert insights from Adam Kelly and Elliott Newell of <a href="http://www.thesportinmind.com">www.thesportinmind.com</a>.</h3>\r\n<p>As a huge sports fan from Yorkshire I have to say I was delighted when we recently confirmed our sponsorship of Yorkshire County Cricket Club (YCCC), especially because the deal included an opportunity for friends of Arena to meet some Yorkshire cricketers.</p>\r\n<p class="FreeFormA">Often I find myself comparing the highs and lows in business to those of the sports arena (much to the delight of my team!) and I see many similarities in the ways success is created and maintained. I also think there is a lot that the business and sporting worlds can learn from each other.</p>\r\n<p class="FreeFormA">So, with this in mind and as part of our activity with YCCC we have called on a few experts to shed light on what makes a strong team, how to keep team members motivated and how to drive positive morale.</p>\r\n<p class="FreeFormA">In the first of this series we turn to sports science specialists from www.thesportinmind.com as we address ways to train a winning team. Please let us know what you think of this piece on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/ArenaGroup" target="_blank">@ArenaGroup</a> &ndash; we would love to hear about your own experiences too.</p>\r\n<h2 class="FreeForm"><img src="../../../assets/articles/144/contained_images/e97a9dd5d459_219_GetRealSign.jpg?1374666961" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" align="right" />Ditch the Training Drills, Get Real</h2>\r\n<p class="FreeForm">Adam Kelly, ex-county cricketer, PhD researcher and Sports Scientist at <a href="http://www.thesportinmind/">www.thesportinmind</a> suggestes a key element of success is training your team for real life scenarios, and that training drills outside of true match conditions are limited in their impact. Sporting professionals identify the correct stimuli quicker and produce faster, more accurate and correct responses. After all, the purpose of training is to improve skill execution and this occurs by recognising the correct stimuli.</p>\r\n<p class="FreeFormA">I can see that this makes sense in business. We often send staff on courses to update their skills but the benefit is not delivered until the learned theory is put into practice back in the workplace. Possibly the most successful development we see is from our apprentices. This is undoubtedly because they have real life situations to experience and test their responses on, whereas less hands-on training is about taking in information, digesting it, and hoping it&rsquo;s still there to call upon when you need it.</p>\r\n<p class="FreeFormA">Similarly, the above applies to experience. For example; the more we experience a particular business situation, the better our execution and outcomes generally become. This further accentuates the benefit of on the job experience in business.</p>\r\n<h2 class="FreeFormA">There&rsquo;s no &lsquo;I&rsquo; in team</h2>\r\n<p class="FreeFormA"><img src="../../../assets/articles/144/contained_images/8bd30c157e16_220_ruggascrum.jpg?1374668062" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" align="right" />Ok, so this is an overused saying but one that is key to developing a successful team. The greater good has to be appreciated by the team as a whole, even on the occasions when decisions don&rsquo;t sit well with individuals. Elliott Newall, an Applied Sports and Performance Psychologist from sportsinmind.com said: &ldquo;A truly cohesive team becomes more than just individuals, and their combined performance equates to more than they could give individually.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class="FreeFormA">From a business perspective I think this comes back to communicating a strong philosophy and earning the team&rsquo;s commitment. Regular reviews bring attention back to the bigger picture and the results of their combined efforts, encouraging individuals to hit their own targets towards the shared goal.</p>\r\n<h2 class="FreeFormA">Faith or Fact?</h2>\r\n<p class="FreeFormA">Newall believes that in order to establish how to best support the team it&rsquo;s important to determine your role clearly. As a supporting influence, are you there to enhance the unwavering faith of the team&rsquo;s capabilities, or are you better off delivering the brutal facts about their present state? Choosing an approach largely depends on the state of play but we must be prepared to do both.</p>\r\n<p class="FreeFormA"><img src="../../../assets/articles/144/contained_images/ddc83092e7fa_221_Cricket_huddle.jpg?1374668298" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" align="right" />He also stresses the importance of adapting to individuals, to be able to deal with multiple types of character and bring them together in one direction. A comment I particularly resonated with was; &ldquo;Remember you&rsquo;re trying to get people on the same page, but that a page is a lot bigger than you might realise - they don&rsquo;t have to be on the same word or letter, just part of the same narrative&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p class="FreeFormA">This makes total sense to me as a company director. In good times and bad, a consistent and fair leadership style, combined with an ability to inspire in your team with your own vision, desire and passion to achieve is rewarded time after time by hard work and top class performance.</p>\r\n<h2 class="FreeFormA">Lead to win, even when you&rsquo;re losing</h2>\r\n<p class="FreeFormA"><img src="../../../assets/articles/144/contained_images/19fbc12a9dfc_223_successSign.jpg?1374670263" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" align="right" />A question we asked of Newall is whether it&rsquo;s right to change your leadership style in response to poor results. He recommends avoiding knee-jerk reactions - why uproot your tried and tested systems, processes and ingrained ideology, just because things didn&rsquo;t work out this time? Obviously, if your losing streak continues then alarm bells should ring; review your fundamentals, commit to what you believe in and refine your approach.</p>\r\n<p class="FreeFormA">From a business perspective, we could relate this to the loss of a sale, which can make you question everything. Is our pricing out? Is our offer wrong? I&rsquo;d say; probably not if a similar approach has previously succeeded. I do believe that both business and sports leadership require a strong faith, some perspective and confidence in the systems and people you are working with.</p>\r\n<h2 class="FreeFormA">Is it all about being the best?</h2>\r\n<p class="FreeForm"><img src="../../../assets/articles/144/contained_images/80328eaf15d2_224_arrows.jpg?1374670430" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" align="right" />Often in business and in sport our focus is on &lsquo;being the best&rsquo; and this is instilled in the mentality of team members as the ultimate goal. Newall believes that this attitude is, in essence, dangerous. He says: &ldquo;In my experience, a high performing team is not necessarily obsessed with being the best full stop; rather they are obsessed with being the best they can be and with the processes that lead to being the best. This is far more controllable and as a result, is far more likely to lead to positive types of motivation and more engaged performance behaviours (like being persistent in the face of challenges, being creative and open to new ideas and being co-operative with other teammates).&rdquo; That makes a lot of sense and I think both sports teams and businesses would do well to bring a little more depth to what success really means to them.</p>\r\n<h2 class="FreeForm">With a truly united team anything is possible.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2>\r\n<p class="FreeFormA"><img src="../../../assets/articles/144/contained_images/ce9797d1885d_225_TugoWar.jpg?1374670630" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" align="right" />At the end of the interview, Newall concludes on the importance of a cohesive team; &ldquo;a strong sense of team identity can often pull a team through a difficult period. It can motivate and inspire as well as increase effort and determination.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class="FreeFormA">I agree wholeheartedly with this; Arena certainly couldn&rsquo;t be successful without an amazing set of people on board. I must add that building a team of people who are all pulling in the same direction and driven by the same passion is no mean feat. The role of the leadership team is vital to providing continual inspiration and good communication. Relationships inside and outside of the team, and recognition of great performance are also key.</p>\r\n<p class="FreeFormA">We&rsquo;re looking forward to the success of YCCC this season, and will be  calling on their coaching team for some words of wisdom over the next  few weeks.

It’s quick and cheap, with the convenient benefit that the recipient of your message doesn’t have to be available when you are. This doesn’t change the fact that an e-mail is a formal record, just like any other piece of written communication, subject to the same obligations, duties of care, controls and legislation. Neil Maude explores the rules and common approaches towards compliance.', '<p class="introduction">The Information and Records Management Society (IRMS) curates a regularly updated &ldquo;Records Management Toolkit&rdquo; written specifically to assist UK public sector schools in their compliance with the Freedom of Information Act 2000. In a series of articles, Arena&rsquo;s Neil Maude looks at the practical application of the principles described in this toolkit, using Arena&rsquo;s 20+ years of experience in the provision of document management solutions within and outside of the education sector.</p>\r\n<h1>Part 5: Email Management</h1>\r\n<p>E-mail has become the communication tool of choice for most office workers. It&rsquo;s quick and cheap, with the convenient benefit that the recipient of your message doesn&rsquo;t have to be available when you are.<br /><br />But even though e-mail, like a letter or a memo, is just another way to pass on a message, somehow we treat it differently. For starters, e-mails tend to be written using less formal language, and most people spend less time on the layout of an e-mail than they would if sending the same message in a letter.<br /><br />However, this doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that an e-mail is a formal record, just like any other piece of written communication &ndash; and therefore subject to the same obligations, duties of care, controls and legislation. Although the IRMS toolkit has a separate section for e-mail management, in the same way that this series is discussing e-mails specifically, the same principles apply as for any other paper or electronic documentation.<br /><br />In particular, e-mails sent or received by a school are subject to the same Data Protection Act (1998) and Freedom of Information (2000) legislation as any other information held.</p>\r\n<h2>Where e-mail is different</h2>\r\n<p>Besides the less formal use of e-mail, there are some key points which set it apart from other documents and records.</p>\r\n<h3>An e-mail system comes with the innate ability to store material.</h3>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s very easy to create folders, retain sent messages and so on. Without appropriate policies in place, e-mail can rapidly become an unofficial and unmanaged information repository.</p>\r\n<h3>Email volumes can be high and correspondence can involve large groups of people.</h3>\r\n<p>This can make management of email time-consuming, or even stress-inducing.</p>\r\n<h3>The speedy and informal nature of email can lead to unintended consequences.</h3>\r\n<p>There is far more potential for a recipient to misunderstand a quick e-mail note than would be the case with a carefully crafted letter or a phone call.<br /><br />The IRMS toolkit contains a number of techniques for addressing the second and third points. These include appropriate communication standards, awareness that an e-mail is a communication like any other (and so deserves the same respect) and also a number of techniques for handling e-mail volume &ndash; such as only checking e-mail at set times daily.</p>\r\n<h2>Filing e-mail</h2>\r\n<p>Because e-mail records must be treated with the same care as other documents, it is essential that they are filed in the same way and the same retention rules are applied. In practice, this requires both a clear policy for e-mail storage and the tools to do the job efficiently.<br /><br />The IRMS Toolkit suggests two options: print it out or save it as an electronic file. Both of these methods avoid the e-mail system being used as a long term store, which is sensible, but each presents problems.</p>\r\n<h2>Printing</h2>\r\n<p>Obviously, printing costs money and e-mail is no exception &ndash; doubly so when you then get a reply and have to print that e-mail as well. We often undertake archive conversion projects (digitising an archive) where up to half of the documentation is made up of printed e-mails &ndash; documents which were digital to start with.<br /><br />A further hidden cost is that e-mails typically include some colour (signature lines, URLs, addresses) and if you&rsquo;re not careful this can lead to e-mails being printed as colour documents &ndash; even more expensive. Regardless of this, printing should really only be considered if you have to file emails in existing paper files.</p>\r\n<h2>Electronic filing</h2>\r\n<p>The second alternative suggested by the IRMS is to save e-mails to disk, outside of the e-mail system, using the &lsquo;Save As&rsquo; function. This has the added benefit that the e-mail will be held together with any attachments &ndash; as it should be, to maintain a complete record of the discussion.<br /><br />However, this also has a drawback; saving files in the standard ''.msg'' format (if you use Microsoft Outlook) means that you&rsquo;ll need Outlook to open those files again in the future. This is likely to be fine for a few years but probably not if the record has to be kept for many years &ndash; such as until the former pupil has reached 25 or 30 years of age. When capturing the electronic archives of organisations, we have encountered several cases of obsolete file types used with older programs such as WordPerfect (anyone remember it?) which dates back as far as the mid-1990s.</p>\r\n<h2>The alternative</h2>\r\n<p>A better solution is to make use of an appropriate Electronic Document Management System (EDMS). A good system will provide the following features which are really key to good e-mail management:</p>\r\n<h3>1. Efficient tools for storing e-mails</h3>\r\n<p>Ideally buttons within the e-mail client or quick links from the computer desktop that enable a user to file an email in the correct place within the EDMS very quickly; i.e.; with minimal mouse clicks and typing.</p>\r\n<h3>2. Maintaining integrity of the record</h3>\r\n<p>The e-mail and any attachments should be held together.</p>\r\n<h3>3. Management of file formats</h3>\r\n<p>Emails are converted to a long-term archive format, such as PDF/A standard. This will avoid creating a store of information which you can&rsquo;t read in the future.<br /><br />And of course, use of an EDMS will bring the same benefits as those enjoyed for scanned information. A proper document classification policy allows retention rules to be implemented and the e-mail is managed for the whole of its relevant lifecycle. In this way, e-mails regarding students are managed according to the rules for that type of content, as are financial records and all the other types of record created by the school.<br /><br />Whichever option you choose, it&rsquo;s crucial to enforce a robust <a href="../113?tag=Expert+News" target="_blank">records management policy</a>, to ensure that emails are treated in the same way as other document types, and filed outside of the personal inboxes of your employees.</p>\r\n<h2>Monitoring</h2>\r\n<p>Because e-mail is an IT application, it is possible to monitor how it is being used and even to automatically create an indexed copy of all e-mail traffic to allow searching and analysis. Doing this provides the school with the capability to protect against a number of risks.<br /><br />However, it is essential to clearly document how this monitoring will be done and how the information may be used, in order to enable the school to evidence that it has the consent of staff, students and everyone else using the e-mail system. This can be a sensitive subject which introduces an associated &lsquo;Big Brother&rsquo; perception. However, it is the best practice and there is an excellent guide from the Information Commissioner&rsquo;s Office (ICO) as to how to do this in an appropriate and compliant manner.<br /><br />Another potential use of e-mail monitoring is to tackle cyber-bullying. With a captured archive of e-mail, it is a simple matter to create a searchable text-index of all the e-mails which were sent or received by your student e-mail server. This archive can then be interrogated for key phrases or messages between particular individuals.</p>\r\n<h2>Three ways to reduce e-mail dependence</h2>\r\n<p>As mentioned earlier, large amounts of e-mail (like the 80-100 items I receive on an average day) can be a source of stress. I&rsquo;d like to share a few simple tactics I&rsquo;ve used to manage e-mail in an efficient way.</p>\r\n<h3>1. E-mail is an &ldquo;asynchronous&rdquo; tool</h3>\r\n<p>There is no need to respond immediately. Turn off or ignore the pop-up icons and deal with your e-mails at a few set times each day. Interruptions are terrible for productivity, so don&rsquo;t create them by reading each e-mail as it arrives. If there is something really vital, the sender should really be phoning you &ndash; I&rsquo;ve put this to the test and the &ldquo;red exclamation&rdquo; e-mails are always followed up by a phone call if they really are that urgent!

Whilst a team is united by a common cause, ultimately everyone, as an individual, thinks differently to a certain degree. Renowned sportsman, Anthony McGrath explains how important it is to recognise this.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I think the biggest mistake you can make is to treat everyone in the same way&rdquo;, said Anthony. As a previous captain of the Yorkshire team, he&rsquo;s seen the power of effective communication, which leads to team members delivering to their full potential.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to recognise that people have different drivers - different triggers that help them perform. Some players are driven by receiving praise, some by admiration from their colleagues, some by financial gain and others by trophies and awards. As a captain it&rsquo;s key to recognise this and appreciate that everyone&rsquo;s input is individual, that each person needs to be motivated in a way they will respond to, in order to make the team work effectively overall. A &lsquo;one size fits all&rsquo; approach is destined to fail so commitment to treating team members as individuals is absolutely crucial.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>This is of course also true in business. Whilst everyone is working towards achieving the goals of our 5 year plan at Arena, each person in the business has a different role to play in that and naturally each person also has their own individual drivers for being a part of it. What&rsquo;s important to me is that we unite as a team and keep each other focused, whatever our personal motivations may be.</p>\r\n<h2>Praise for Progress</h2>\r\n<p>We all know that it makes sense to give praise when great achievements have been made - but how often do we offer praise for the little things? McGrath says; &ldquo;as a leader it is very important to give praise and feedback on a regular basis, to reinforce a positive mentality and maintain motivation.&rdquo; He also believes this helps to keep people driven towards their ultimate goal, as it focuses the mind on being able to achieve success through continuing to perform well.</p>\r\n<p>At Arena we work hard on this and sometimes just a manager&rsquo;s effort to say a quiet thank you goes a very long way in terms of motivation. Other ways include sharing of internal news bulletins to acknowledge and encourage best practice across the business; and team celebrations of success that take the form of a mention in a meeting or a special event. I&rsquo;d agree that praise shown in a variety of ways certainly contributes towards team motivation.</p>\r\n<h2>Cut the Criticism</h2>\r\n<p>This is obviously all well and good when things are going well, but what about when things take a downward turn...?</p>\r\n<p>McGrath&rsquo;s advice on this is clear - it&rsquo;s still about unity and teamwork and as a leader you must be seen to support the whole team, even if it appears that there is an individual with whom you could lay some blame; &ldquo;if something needs to be addressed with an individual team member then do it privately. Never, ever single someone out publicly with a criticism&rdquo;, he says.</p>\r\n<p>He also suggests laying down some non-negotiable rules for the team to follow, which will result in the team pulling together and being motivated as one. &ldquo;By taking time out to put these rules into action, players get a feeling of belonging, trust and appreciation from their management.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>This is certainly similar in business and a set of rules means everyone works to the same standards and expectations are clear and understood.</p>\r\n<p>If the team as a whole is under performing this is a different matter, and McGrath then advises an approach based on reviewing and refining. &ldquo;No team can perform flawlessly 100% of the time. There will also be times when things don&rsquo;t go to plan due to factors out of your control. This is when strong belief comes in and you need that unity and focus on the end goal to pick things up&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<h2>Keeping your head up</h2>\r\n<p>In times of trouble a strong leader remains consistent with actions, words and behaviours whilst always appearing calm and collected. McGrath&rsquo;s sporting experience re-iterates this. &ldquo;If you become too emotional you can make a rash decision or say something you will later regret. Portraying a calm exterior even when inside you feel completely different shows a rational approach&nbsp;to your team. This will help them stay motivated and maintain their faith that everything will work out in the end&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>Anthony believes that it&rsquo;s also not always necessary to dissect every detail when things go wrong. &ldquo;After a loss, if you have the right environment, players will analyse themselves and learn from the bad performance. Dedicated team members will perform their own mini reviews and make their own conclusions as to how they can improve. Guide but don&rsquo;t push too much, as change led by the team can be more powerful than change led from the top.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>I am a true believer in keeping a positive attitude in business when things aren&rsquo;t going your way. This is not easy but when you&rsquo;re in a team, people do look to the top for inspiration, guidance and reassurance that things are on track. I recognise the commitment needed from the management team; if we appear frustrated then why should anyone else feel different?</p>\r\n<h2>The Power of the Team Talk</h2>\r\n<p>Sometimes the only thing for it is a strong team talk to boost morale.</p>\r\n<p>McGrath advises to never end things on a negative note. &ldquo;You have to provide an outcome, a way out, a positive motivator for the team to focus on&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>In business I believe the same holds true. I&rsquo;ve found that the best approach to take with a motivational team talk is to be honest, speak from the heart and say something people can really identify with. This way you&rsquo;re not trying to railroad staff with a &lsquo;speech&rsquo; as such, but you&rsquo;re engaging them with real feelings and emotions.</p>\r\n<p>McGrath recalls his favourite motivational team talk when he played for Yorkshire County Cricket Club, when the team were on the brink of winning the Championship for the first time since 1968:</p>\r\n<h3><em><span class="font_blue">"The 11 guys in this room are about to go into the history books, you represent&nbsp;everything Yorkshire cricket stands for. Anyone who loves Yorkshire cricket would give anything to swap places with you now. We have been the best team all season because we have stuck to our processes and believed in each other. If we do the same today no one can deny us. Express yourselves, show how good you are and look out for each other. Let&rsquo;s go!"</span></em></h3>\r\n<p>For McGrath, this speech worked as it summed up the mood of the team and reaffirmed the belief that management had in them. Here could lie the secret of tapping into true motivational management - making your team feel valued and a part of something special. I can&rsquo;t argue with that.</p>\r\n<p>Many thanks to Anthony McGrath for his insights, it&rsquo;s great to hear from a Yorkshire sporting legend. We&rsquo;re looking forward to the success of YCCC this season &ndash; and waiting in anticipation to see whether they pull another great championship win out of the bag!</p>\r\n<h3 class="FreeFormA"><em><span class="font_blue">Many thanks to</span><span class="font_blue"> our expert contributor Anthony McGrath.&nbsp;</span><span class="font_blue"><a href="http://twitter.com/SportinMind" target="_blank"></a></span></em></h3>\r\n<h2 class="FreeFormA">Join the discussion</h2>\r\n<p class="FreeFormA"><a href="http://twitter.com/ArenaGroup" target="_blank"><img src="../../../assets/articles/144/contained_images/83b9192871c0_218_twitter-icon_ws.png?1374664991" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="50" align="left" />Follow us @ArenaGroup</a>: We would love to hear your thoughts on this feature - why not enter our <a href="../../../articles/143" target="_blank">competition</a> to win YCCC goodies too?!</p>\r\n<p class="FreeFormA">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>About Adrian Fitzpatrick</h3>\r\n<p><img src="../../../assets/articles/144/contained_images/15ad6e0783c2_217_AdrianF_1.jpg?1374664486" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" align="left" /></p>\r\n<p>Managing Director<br />Tel: 0844 863 8000</p>\r\n<p>Adrian is one of two remaining founding partners who established Arena in 1991; he leads a team of over 150 people who are working together towards ambitious expansion goals.

Arena’s Neil Maude looks at mitigating the risk and what to do when the worst happens.', '<p class="introduction">The IRMS curates a regularly updated toolkit to assist UK public sector schools in their compliance with the Freedom of Information Act (2000).</p>\r\n<p class="introduction">Arena Group''s Neil Maude has written for us a series of articles looking at the practical application of its key principles. In Part 6, Neil looks at disaster recovery planning and risk mitigation.</p>\r\n<h1>Part 6: Risk and Disaster Recovery</h1>\r\n<p>The 7th principle of the Data Protection Act (1998) is quite clear on the obligations with regard to data security and risk: "Appropriate technical and organisational measures shall be taken against unauthorized or unlawful processing of personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, personal data."</p>\r\n<p>The IRMS Toolkit makes the very valid point that: "In the event of a major incident, your school should be able to stay open and will at least have access to its key administrative and teaching records."<br /><br />Clearly, compliance with this legislation requires on-going management of the risks to your information stores and how these risks will be mitigated.<br /><br />These obligations can be covered by appropriate use of technology, but only once the underlying business needs have been appraised. A first step is an information audit, as described in a previous article in this series, upon which risk assessments and mitigation plans can be created.</p>\r\n<h2>Risk assessment</h2>\r\n<h2>Step 1: Three important questions<br /><br /></h2>\r\n<div>A good place to start with risk analysis is to look at each type of information identified in the information audit with three questions in mind:<br /><br /></div>\r\n<h3>1. Event: What might happen to this information?</h3>\r\n<div>Think about how the information is stored. Could it be lost or destroyed in its current form (is paper at risk of fire or flood; could electronic files be lost if the server crashes)? How might the information ''leak'' out of the organisation (theft, USB stick loss, unauthorised disclosure, e-mail to the wrong person)? This question should identify a number of risks against each specific piece of information.<br /><br /></div>\r\n<h3>2. Probability: How likely is this to actually happen?</h3>\r\n<div>For example, a fire is a fairly unlikely risk. However, if you store data on USB disks, it is fairly likely that someone will lose one.<br /><br /></div>\r\n<h3>3. Impact: What would be the impact?</h3>\r\n<div>Some risks have bigger impacts than others. If you can&rsquo;t locate a permission slip, then you can ask for another to be created &ndash; a low impact event. However, if someone has left an SEN file on the bus, that&rsquo;s a serious problem.<br /><br /></div>\r\n<h2>Step 2: Plot your risk priorities</h2>\r\n<div><br /><br />When you have this information, categorise each event by its probability and impact (low, medium or high) and plot each event onto a grid with probability on the x-axis and impact on the y-axis. Key issues will appear in the top-right, giving you a good appreciation of your risk priorities and where to start.<br />&nbsp;<br />Take care not to neglect events which may be unlikely but would have a very serious impact; these &ldquo;Black Swan&rdquo; events will still need some thought, prevention and possibly even a coping strategy.<br /><br /></div>\r\n<h2>Step 3: Mitigation plans</h2>\r\n<div><br /><br />The next step is to consider risk mitigation &ndash; what can you do about some of these risks to reduce their impact or remove them altogether?<br /><br />The IRMS toolkit describes a number of mitigations to general IT risks including off-site and secure backups, password policies and having no fragile or sensitive data stored on local PCs or laptops. This is all essential.<br /><br />The Toolkit also discusses the risks associated with loss of paper documents in a flood or fire and the benefits of metal cabinets over open shelves, as well as the need for auditing of paper file locations and clear desk policies. These are, again, all essential if using paper files &ndash; but these steps only mitigate the risks, rather than removing them.<br /><br />The application of an appropriate Electronic Document Management System (EDMS) can remove the risks to physical paperwork, by removing it, and placing the information archive into the protection of IT mitigation procedures. If this is done, information stores such as pupil files are covered by the same processes and policies as any other IT backup &ndash; greatly reducing risks and saving time by covering a multitude of risks together. An EDMS can also provide access security and auditing, thereby removing many information leakage risks.<br /><br /></div>\r\n<h2>Continuity planning</h2>\r\n<div><br /><br />Having undertaken a risk management exercise, determined impacts and mitigated as much as possible, the next step is to compile a list of actions which will be taken should the worst happen &ndash; and in what timeframes.<br /><br />Again, this builds on the information audit and the key question is how quickly does each classification of information need to be made available again? Once this is understood, the order of restoring IT systems (typically) can be defined &ndash; and then this should be subject to some real-world thinking as to whether it is practical. For example, if a file server contains information which is required to be made available within 24 hours of a server failure, can the backup be restored to a spare server or does a new server need to be procured?<br /><br />If a new server is required &ndash; maybe the spare server is also likely to be destroyed? &ndash; then there needs to be a plan for how this will be achieved to meet the overall elapsed time requirement.<br /><br /></div>\r\n<h2>Test, test and test again&hellip;</h2>\r\n<div><br /><br />A continuity plan is something you hope never to need. But it must be tested &ndash; and that testing should be regularly repeated. Without testing, you have no assurance that the plan is complete, actionable and up-to-date. This can be a painful and time-consuming process but it&rsquo;s just not possible to write a plan which is error-free, and you don&rsquo;t want to meet the problems when you are already in the midst of a crisis.<br /><br /></div>\r\n<h2>When the worst happens</h2>\r\n<div><br /><br />Sadly, we have seen cases where large amounts of paper documents have been lost. Examples include fires destroying buildings used for information storage, floods wiping out basement archives and even leaky roofs causing irreparable damage. We&rsquo;ve also seen a surprising number of servers lost without an up-to-date backup being available. In most of these cases, a major impact has been suffered because a thorough risk assessment and/or regular process checking were not done. Having said this, some events were acknowledged as low-probability/high-impact risks against which the organisation had taken a conscious and calculated risk.<br /><br />The IRMS toolkit states that an individual should be appointed as the "named member of staff to liaise with the Information Commissioner&rsquo;s Office in the event that a major information breach needs to be reported". We hope that by following these guidelines, and by using appropriate technology, this named person will have no need to speak to the ICO!</div>\r\n<h3>About Neil Maude</h3>\r\n<p><img src="../../../assets/articles/113/contained_images/8d9e8419f6d7_180_NeilM_ws.jpg?1359557446" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" align="left" /></p>\r\n<p>Electronic Document Management General Manager<br />Tel: 0844 863 8000 | Email: <a href="mailto:neilM@arenagroup.net">neilM@arenagroup.net</a></p>\r\n<p>Neil joined the Arena Group in 2006 and has almost 20 years of  experience in the electronic document management industry, working with  both private and public sector customers.&nbsp; Neil sits on Arena&rsquo;s board of  directors and manages the delivery operations of Arena&rsquo;s EDM business.&nbsp;  His team spend their time developing software, implementing solutions  for customers and providing after-sales software support services, both  in the UK and internationally.</p>\r\n<h2>Further information</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href="http://www.irms.org.uk/resources/information-guides/199-rm-toolkit-for-school">IRMS Records Management Toolkit for Schools Version 4</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="../../../page/electronic-document-management">Document management software from Arena Group</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="../../../case_studies?tag=Education">Case Studies: EDM in Education</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="../../../assets/stored_documents/original/63_Papers on Rec Mment Education 102013v1_WebsiteVersion.pdf" target="_blank">Complete compliance guide: records management in schools</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Other papers in this series:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href="../../../articles/113?tag=Expert+News" target="_blank">#1: Creating a records management policy</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="../../../articles/120" target="_blank">#2: Conducting a 5 step information audit</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="../../../articles/131" target="_blank">#3: Information access and security</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="../../../articles/136">#4: Information Disposal</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="../../../articles/147?tag=Expert+News">#5: Email Management</a></li>\r\n</ul>', '2013-08-26', 'emergencyStop_ws.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 82927, '2014-12-11 15:43:22', '', '2013-08-12 09:42:14', '2014-12-11 15:43:22', 7, 3, 0, NULL, 1, 0, NULL, 'records-management-in-schools-6-risk-and-disaster-recovery'),

In each case these changes were consciously made in order to stay ahead of the game.&rdquo;&nbsp; In simple terms we should always remain on the look-out for changes towards improvement &ndash; even if those changes appear daunting.&nbsp; Kyle adds; &ldquo;strong and committed athletes know the value of change and that in time they will be rewarded. Having said this though, it&rsquo;s important to remember than it takes time to adjust to change and recover success &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t happen overnight.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class="BodyText1">Again this draws a variety of parallels with business, where a conscious, logical and proactive attitude towards change beats burying our heads in the sand for fear of rocking the boat. Obviously, there is no value in making change for change&rsquo;s sake but positive reflection and challenging the way things are done can certainly produce new ideas and improve results.</p>\r\n<h2 class="BodyText1">Communicate clearly</h2>\r\n<p class="BodyText1">Kelly comments on the huge importance of two-way communication to the overall success of an athlete. &ldquo;In order to effectively cope with high amounts of stress, a strong communicative environment needs to be established through which to express concerns and receive positive feedback. We must create an environment which is supportive and allows the athlete to flourish.&rdquo; Communication and quick action to fix any issues allows us to minimise stress, earn trust and cope productively. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to remember that the communication needs to work both ways &ndash; coaches who listen to their teams and act on feedback will earn the trust to make positive changes.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class="BodyText1">From a business perspective we can easily relate this to the office environment. &nbsp;Successful communication is fundamental to the creation of trust, which is crucial for a stress free workplace. Much like a sports environment, a workplace needs to be open and supportive, to embrace change and develop talent. Communication also allows office changes and stresses to be dealt with immediately, removing the threat of any negativity brewing. The sharing of rationale, vision, ideas and ultimately business results, all make for a happy and motivated team. I can most definitely vouch for this and believe our strength in this area is what has enabled our business to grow at such a rapid pace without jeopardizing employee engagement.</p>\r\n<p class="BodyText1">Most vitally, it could be suggested that much like in the sporting world, effective communication allows for a greater sense of team spirit, allowing all within the work environment to not only hit individual goals but also work effectively towards shared targets.</p>\r\n<h2 class="BodyText1">Make a change to see a change</h2>\r\n<p class="BodyText1">Kelly explains that understanding the need to develop and change is a vital characteristic for any athlete, and one that enables them to remove unnecessary stressors. &ldquo;In short, if an athlete takes the time to listen to their coach, understand and act upon the feedback they are given, they stand a chance of making real improvement. Athletes must take on board feedback, in order to remain at the top of their game and stand shoulder to shoulder with competitors.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class="BodyText1">Similarly, the above applies to business &ndash; we must always look for the gaps in our performance in order to achieve greater results. We can go further and say that sometimes we need to try something different in order to break a negative cycle &ndash; how can we expect a different result, if we don&rsquo;t change our behaviour?&nbsp; Actively seeking ways to improve and testing new ideas will provide a welcome challenge but leads to improvement - which naturally removes stress.</p>\r\n<p class="BodyText1">Finally, being able to share success with your team is a very rewarding feeling, and I cannot advocate enough the importance of making people feel valued, especially in times of stress.</p>\r\n<h3 class="BodyText1"><em class="font_blue">Many thanks to our contributors, Adam Kelly of www.thesportinmind.com and Kyle McDonald of Competitive Will Performance Consulting. </em></h3>\r\n<h2 class="FreeFormA">Join the discussion</h2>\r\n<p class="FreeFormA"><a href="http://twitter.com/ArenaGroup" target="_blank"><img src="../../../assets/articles/144/contained_images/83b9192871c0_218_twitter-icon_ws.png?1374664991" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="50" align="left" />Follow us @ArenaGroup</a>: We would love to hear your thoughts on this feature - why not enter our <a href="../../../articles/143" target="_blank">competition</a> to win YCCC goodies too?!</p>\r\n<p class="FreeFormA">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>About Adrian Fitzpatrick</h3>\r\n<p><img src="../../../assets/articles/144/contained_images/15ad6e0783c2_217_AdrianF_1.jpg?1374664486" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" align="left" /></p>\r\n<p>Managing Director<br />Tel: 0844 863 8000</p>\r\n<p>Adrian is one of two remaining founding partners who established Arena in 1991; he leads a team of over 150 people who are working together towards ambitious expansion goals.

(153, 'Digital Revolution for UK Credit Unions', 'Letting go of paper can release serious competitive advantage. Arena''s Document Solutions Specialist, Dan Lancaster, explores the phenomenon currently sweeping through several UK credit unions.', '<p><span class="introduction">Letting go of paper is releasing serious competitive advantage for several UK credit unions. Arena''s Document Solutions Specialist, Dan Lancaster, explores the impact of digitisation within the sector.</span><br /><br />In response to ever-growing member numbers, several UK credit unions are taking up the challenge of reducing their reliance on paper. Increased storage space, improved legal compliance and many other outcomes are giving them a serious competitive advantage. <br /><br />Many credit unions are dealing with more members as a result of the tough economic climate. This means increasing volumes of documentation that presents a growing challenge. Possibly at the top of the agenda is the need to balance legal requirements relating to the handling of confidential documents and data, with the need to improve customer service levels in response to a more competitive environment. Electronic document management software, often referred to as an EDRMS, is a proven solution that can deliver a surprising number of benefits.</p>\r\n<h2>What is an EDRMS?</h2>\r\n<p>An EDRMS supports the secure storage, sharing, processing and retrieval of documents in digital formats. When a paper document comes into the business it is scanned and all further processing is done electronically. Supported by a robust document management policy and processes, an EDRMS that is aligned with BS10008 enables paper originals to be destroyed.</p>\r\n<h2>What&rsquo;s in it for Credit Unions?</h2>\r\n<p>Taking the paper out of a business has the effect of clearing storage space, which makes for a nicer working environment and happy staff. In addition, there is no need to photocopy paperwork such as proof of identity documents, which are simply scanned into the system. This presents immediate financial savings relating to storage, copying and paper consumption. Eddie Hotham, Finance Manager of Hull and East Yorkshire Credit Union comments; &ldquo;we have saved the cost of document storage and made the set-up of accounts more efficient.&rdquo;<br /><br />As Eddie mentions, an EDRMS places documents, literally, at your fingertips, so there is no need to go searching through paper filing systems and the chaos caused by filing errors is a thing of the past. The direct customer service benefit is that your staff can answer queries immediately, which makes for satisfied members and could even reduce your phone bill. Sharon Walker, Office Manager at Kingdom Credit Union, tells us; &ldquo;our EDRMS is simplifying complex business operations &ndash; we would never go back to traipsing through boxes and boxes of paperwork.&rdquo;<br /><br />There is also a justification in terms of legal compliance and security, as has been found by Nottingham Credit Union. Operations Manager, Ella Ferris confirms; &ldquo;version control prevents documents from being over-written and any changes are logged. Encryption also limits access to confidential files to keep them secure.&rdquo; <br /><br />Sharon explains further, that an EDRMS addresses FSA requirements and offers protection from disasters such as fires and floods. &ldquo;We have total peace of mind that everything is backed up. We can also limit access to the system which is invaluable when you need to retain and protect confidential documents for long periods of time.&rdquo; Good systems also flag documents that have reached their retention expiry date and should be destroyed.</p>\r\n<h2>Top Tips on Functionality and Providers</h2>\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve listed our top 5 considerations to look out for when choosing an EDRMS.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<h3>References:</h3>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Other credit unions are an obvious first port of call, and systems that are developed to meet the unique challenges faced by your business sector should also be on top of the pile.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<h3>Efficiency:</h3>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Seek out a user-friendly system with quick, comprehensive and simple search tools.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<h3>Security:</h3>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Be sure you can control who sees, amends and deletes files.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<h3>Compliance:</h3>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Check that your system is aligned with BS10008, get advice on producing a sound records management policy and look for EDRMS functionality to audit user activity.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<h3>Integration:</h3>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Look out for a system that integrates with your existing software and systems.

(156, '£70bn tied up in inefficient government processes', 'This week, government Think Tank, Policy Exchange, published a report claiming that the UK government could save £24bn per year between now and 2020 through increased use of digital technology.', '<p class="introduction">This week, government Think Tank, Policy Exchange, published a report claiming that the UK government could save &pound;24bn per year between now and 2020 through increased use of digital technology.</p>\r\n<p>The report, entitled &ldquo;<em>smaller, better, faster, stronger &ndash; remaking government for the digital age</em>&rdquo;, cites several areas where major savings could be made &ndash; to the tune of &pound;70bn between now and 2020.</p>\r\n<p>Areas for improvement include IT purchasing and website development; but the multitude of paper-led business processes also came in for criticism: <em>The Crown Prosecution Service prints one million sheets of paper every day, while two articulated lorries arrive at the DVLA daily, carrying letters and paperwork. In order to complete a passport application form online, the Passport  Office will print the form out and post it back for the individual to  sign and send back.&nbsp; </em></p>\r\n<p>So, what''s the answer? We chatted to Arena''s Neil Maude and Ian Fox to get their views on the report.<em><br /></em></p>\r\n<h2>Digitising paper-led processes</h2>\r\n<p>Over recent years we will all have noticed local and national government efforts to reduce the paper trail relating to certain processes. For example, applications for vehicle tax renewal can now be completed online.</p>\r\n<p>Arena&rsquo;s Electronic Document Management General Manager, Neil Maude, comments; &ldquo;Policy Exchange is calling for much greater digitisation of government processes." Neil notes that this could require the state to embrace a number of new technologies but, in his view, an electronic document and records management system (EDRMS) should be high on the wish list. "A well thought through print and copy strategy and a good EDRMS is the bedrock of efficienct document management. The technology has been established for several years, is proving itself in a growing number of businesses and is continually developing so these are logical first steps.</p>\r\n<p>Every day we support businesses in taking steps to digitise their processes and often the action is prompted by a desire to reduce paper and improve efficiencies. The transition can take time and is often managed in stages &ndash; especially in cases where a business manages a large number of processes and has a legacy that is deeply paper-led. Supported by a good document management system (EDRMS) and a robust data management policy and processes, there can be so many knock-on benefits. Greater data security, cost reductions relating to consumables, increased efficiency and improved, faster customer service, to name just a few - so it&rsquo;s certainly worthwhile."</p>\r\n<h2>Think before you print</h2>\r\n<p>As mentioned by Neil, the story doesn&rsquo;t stop with digitising processes, and a good print and copy strategy is fundamental.</p>\r\n<p>Arena''s Professional Services Manager, Ian Fox, comments; "it is difficult to imagine a completely paper-free business and very few truly paperless offices exist. There are some documents that we just need to print."</p>\r\n<p>Ian explains that a good starting point is to review your current print and copy strategy, infrastructure and behaviour. Ian continues; "this review might present various options that might include the development of a policy to nurture greater employee awareness. We may also consider a Managed Print Service to simplify the billing and maintenance of your printers. Combining this with technology to increase transparency and reduce wasteful and unnecessary printing can certainly create a &lsquo;less paper office&rsquo; and all the related benefits. &ndash; Cost savings, a smaller carbon footprint, more considerate user behaviour and greater efficiency."</p>\r\n<h2>Further Information</h2>\r\n<p><a href="http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/publications/category/item/smaller-better-faster-stronger" target="_blank">Policy Exchange report</a></p>\r\n<p><strong></strong><a href="../../page/electronic-document-management" target="_blank"><strong>m</strong>store &ndash; Arena&rsquo;s software for electronic document management (EDRMS)</a></p>\r\n<p><a href="../../page/copy-and-print" target="_blank">MPS &ndash; controlling print and copy</a></p>\r\n<p><a href="../../page/print-control" target="_blank">Print control &ndash; tips for reducing wasteful and unnecessary printing</a></p>\r\n<p><a href="../../case_studies" target="_blank">Case studies &ndash; paper reduction through effective document management</a></p>\r\n<h3>About Neil Maude and Ian Fox</h3>\r\n<p><img src="../../../assets/articles/113/contained_images/8d9e8419f6d7_180_NeilM_ws.jpg?1359557446" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" align="left" /></p>\r\n<p>Neil Maude: Electronic Document Management General Manager<br />Tel: 0844 863 8000 | Email: <a href="mailto:neilM@arenagroup.net">neilM@arenagroup.net</a></p>\r\n<p>Neil joined the Arena Group in 2006 and has almost 20 years of  experience in the electronic document management industry, working with  both private and public sector customers.&nbsp; Neil sits on Arena&rsquo;s board of  directors and manages the delivery operations of Arena&rsquo;s EDM business.&nbsp;  His team spend their time developing software, implementing solutions  for customers and providing after-sales software support services, both  in the UK and internationally.</p>\r\n<p><img src="../../..//assets/articles/156/contained_images/14027a085312_276_Ian Fox Jan15 large.jpg?1422352750" border="0" alt="" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="113" height="113" align="LEFT" />Ian Fox: Professional Services Manager<br />Tel: 0800 863 8000 | Email: <a href="mailto:ianF@arenagroup.net">ianF@arenagroup.net</a></p>\r\n<p>Ian Fox joined the Arena Group as a Systems Engineer in 1995.

On the whole there was a good awareness of the data protection laws but the ICO concluded that schools needed to work harder to meet the requirements.</p>\r\n<p>Almost a year on, we are re-visiting the ICO guidance on Data Protection, to combine their top tips with some practical advice on compliance.</p>\r\n<h2>The ICO&rsquo;s Guidance</h2>\r\n<p>The ICO&rsquo;s top tips towards compliance are to <strong><em>prepare</em></strong>, <strong><em>notify</em></strong>, <strong><em>be fair</em></strong> and <em><strong>keep it secure</strong></em>.</p>\r\n<h2>Prepare</h2>\r\n<p>To ensure full compliance the ICO recommends the enforcement of clear and practical policies in all areas that affect good information governance. Backing these up with written procedures helps staff to be aware of their responsibilities.  Further to this, ensuring that the relevant employees are correctly trained will reduce errors.</p>\r\n<p>The ICO also recommends involving someone knowledgeable about information rights and record management to ensure compliance with the Data Protection Act.</p>\r\n<p>A document audit is a good first step towards clarifying exactly what information is held and crucially how, why, when and who accesses and processes that data.  From that point of understanding, the creation and maintenance of a clear records management policy becomes the natural next step. (See our separate articles on these practices for further advice).</p>\r\n<p>We would agree that it is vital that the responsibility for compliance lies with a senior manager, to ensure the issue is given the prominence it requires. As the report states, &lsquo;information governance is not optional&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<h2>Notify and be fair</h2>\r\n<p>You must notify the ICO of how you use personal data about parents and pupils. A school is responsible for its own notification and keeping the details updated whenever any new purposes for processing personal data are introduced. For example, a school installing CCTV must update its notification accordingly.</p>\r\n<p>As early as possible; before, or as soon as you obtain their personal information, a &ldquo;fair processing notice&rdquo; should be given to parents and pupils. This details what personal information is being collected and why.</p>\r\n<p>Giving ownership of your records management policy to a senior member of your management team will ensure that these notification rules are kept in mind. The notification will need attention when any new processes or mechanisms are implemented that will impact upon how data is captured, processed or stored.</p>\r\n<h2>Keep it secure</h2>\r\n<p>The report states that fair processing &lsquo;<em>requires that you control access to personal information</em>&rsquo;. Systems need to be put in place to ensure that only those people who need information have access to it; and only when they need it.</p>\r\n<p>An electronic document and records management system (EDRMS) is a good option for managing this. Functionality to set passwords for individual users, and to control which information they can access, can help you to comply. A good EDRMS will also let you report on user activity and evidence that documents are secure.</p>\r\n<p>Data access via personal devices such as laptops, tablets and mobile phones was a key area highlighted by the report. Electronic devices must be kept secure; this is a legal requirement if those devices hold confidential personal data. The ICO advises putting procedures in place to monitor devices being taken out of school and when data is transmitted. In these instances, strong passwords must be used and memory keys; identified in the report as one of the main routes for data loss, should be fully encrypted.</p>\r\n<p>Once again, there are systems on the market that can ensure compliance with these rules. Keeping your data in a secure EDRMS that is accessible via an internet browser, for example, is one way to ensure security and monitor data access, whilst removing the need to transfer data onto any mobile devices.</p>\r\n<p>Following the ICO&rsquo;s recommendations will ensure that you do not fall foul of the changing Data Protection laws. The effort of putting policies and procedures in place and then to stay up to date is far outweighed by the potential damage to a school&rsquo;s reputation, not to mention the financial penalties, that could be incurred by not complying.</p>\r\n<h3>About Neil Maude</h3>\r\n<p><img src="../../assets/articles/113/contained_images/8d9e8419f6d7_180_NeilM_ws.jpg?1359557446" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" align="left" /></p>\r\n<p>Electronic Document Management General Manager<br />Tel: 0800 863 8000 | Email: <a href="mailto:neilM@arenagroup.net">neilM@arenagroup.net</a></p>\r\n<p>Neil joined the Arena Group in 2006 and has almost 20 years of   experience in the electronic document management industry, working with   both private and public sector customers.&nbsp; Neil sits on Arena&rsquo;s board  of  directors and manages the delivery operations of Arena&rsquo;s EDM  business.&nbsp;  His team spend their time developing software, implementing  solutions  for customers and providing after-sales software support  services, both  in the UK and internationally.</p>\r\n<h2>Further information</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href="http://www.ico.org.uk/news/latest_news/2012/~/media/documents/library/Data_Protection/Research_and_reports/report_dp_guidance_for_schools.ashx" target="_blank">View the full ICO report</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="../../../page/electronic-document-management">Electronic document management from Arena Group (EDRMS)</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="../../../case_studies?tag=Education">Case Studies: EDM in Education</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="../../../articles/149?tag=Expert+News">VIDEO: Compliance in Education</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Related articles:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href="../../../articles/113?tag=Expert+News" target="_blank">Creating a records management policy</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="../../../articles/120" target="_blank">Conducting a 5 step information audit</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="../../../articles/131" target="_blank">Information access and security</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="../../../articles/136">Information Disposal</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="../../../articles/147?tag=Expert+News">Email Management</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="../../../articles/150" target="_blank">Risk and disaster recovery</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n</ul>', '2013-09-09', 'SECURElaptop_ws.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 52805, '2014-12-11 14:43:51', '', '2013-09-05 09:04:51', '2014-12-11 14:43:51', 7, 3, 0, NULL, 1, 0, NULL, 'ico-guidance-on-data-protection-compliance-in-schools');

', 'We have taken delivery of some exciting new showroom machines in the form of Toshiba’s new printer that erases toner from regular copy paper - so you can re-use it up to 5 times!', '<p><span class="introduction">Some brand new devices have been delivered to the state-of-the-art showroom at Arena Group''s Armitage House. We''re pretty excited about this revolutionary new hardware from Toshiba that prints using erasable toner.</span></p>\r\n<p>We''ve been reading about the imminent launch of this new technology from Toshiba for quite some time. Now that we actually have the devices in our showroom, we have been testing them out and we are impressed!</p>\r\n<p>News of our new arrival has piqued the interest of our customer base too, with many keen to pop in and see the magical machines at work.</p>\r\n<h2>How does it work?</h2>\r\n<p>A multi-functional device (printer, copier and scanner) prints onto standard paper using special erasable ink which can be removed using an eraser unit. Toner is decolourised using a heated  friction technique, known as FriXion Ball, that renders the sheet of  paper usable again.</p>\r\n<p>A very faint impression of the cleared toner can still be  seen but Toshiba says that paper can be re-used upto 10 times*, resulting in reduced paper consumption and a greener way of working. Once the printer detects that a sheet can&rsquo;t be used anymore, it dispatches  it into a different tray but it''s still clean enough to use for handwritten notes.</p>\r\n<p>A compatible line of pens from Pilot use ink that the printer can delete, so writing on documents  you want to erase isn&rsquo;t an issue.</p>\r\n<p>Deleting documents is not always desirable in cases where important  information needs to be captured. Toshiba have addressed this concern by adding  scanner technology that can create an electronic copy of your documents  before they disappear.</p>\r\n<p>For now the device is only capable of printing blue toner, but we hear that additional colours are in development so eventually we could see a full colour machine.</p>\r\n<p>The obvious benefits of this new technology are reduced paper consumption and the associated reduction in environmental impact that stems from printing and copying. For organisations with targets related to minimised carbon emissions, these machines are certainly worth investigation.</p>\r\n<h2>Further Information</h2>\r\n<p><a href="../../../case_studies/67">Case study: JN Bentley on reduced paper consumption.</a></p>\r\n<p><a href="../../web/contact_us" target="_blank">Contact us</a> for more information about these exciting new devices.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>*Toner coverage determines the number of times a page can be re-used. The toner is not removed from the page but heated to a high temperature which turns it transparent, leaving a faint image on the paper. Once the toner on the paper becomes too thick for the machine to process it, the printer will reject the page. For this reason, pages with a fairly light coverage of toner will be processed more times than those with heavier coverage.</em></p>', '2013-12-20', 'PIC-e-ST306LP-RD30_S_web.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 707594, '2013-09-10 10:54:20', 'Eco-Print', '2013-09-09 12:25:09', '2014-10-08 11:56:29', 3, NULL, 0, NULL, 1, 0, NULL, 'erasable-printing-is-here'),

Legislation is ever-more complex but <strong>m</strong>store,  supported by the right policies and procedures, enables compliance with  the Data Protection and Freedom of Information Acts, for example. This  goes hand-in-hand with a host of other benefits such as freeing-up  office space, savings on document storage, reduced paper consumption, business continuity assurance, improved document security  and so on.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>We continue to develop relationships with existing blue chip clients, who use bespoke <strong>m</strong>store    systems to digitise and manage processes that were formerly  paper-led.  These include mailroom operations and delivery tracking for clients including Leeds  Building Society, Carnival Cruises, The  Card Factory and  Reed Boardall.</p>\r\n<h2>The document experts:</h2>\r\n<p><strong>m</strong>store is a vital element of the overall Arena Group portfolio, completing a full end-to-end document service.

Our Managed Print Service takes the hassle and cost out of managing toner and maintenance on devices. When we look at digitising processes with <strong>m</strong>store too, we start to see serious cost savings and multiple other positive outcomes.

Neil Maude shares some simple steps towards reducing your reliance on paper.', '<p class="introduction">Reducing your reliance on paper is not  an overnight transition but there are some simple steps that will get you started in the right direction.</p>\r\n<p><a href="http://www.aiim.org/" target="_blank">AIIM sponsored World Paper Free Day</a> takes place in October - an event that champions digital processes and efficiency in the workplace. With this in mind, we thought we would bring together some simple steps that a business can take towards reducing its reliance on paper.</p>\r\n<h2>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Planning is the first step</h2>\r\n<p>It is possible to reduce paper usage in any organisation, large or small, and   improve your business processes at the same time   &ndash; but only if you   have a clear plan. Take a close look at your business and how paper is used to see where you can pick "low hanging fruit" and achieve the quickest wins.</p>\r\n<p>In an organisation''s effort to reduce paper, often processes are  digitised one at a time or in phases that focus on departments in turn. For example, you might choose to start with <a href="../../case_studies/26?service=Electronic+Document+Management" target="_blank">accounts payable</a>, <a href="../../../case_studies/36?service=Electronic+Document+Management" target="_blank">sales order processing</a>, <a href="../../../articles/110" target="_blank">purchase-to-pay</a>, <a href="../../case_studies/35?service=Electronic+Document+Management" target="_blank">invoices</a> or your <a href="../../case_studies/25?service=Electronic+Document+Management" target="_blank">mailroom</a>.</p>\r\n<div id="stcpDiv" style="position: absolute; top: -1999px; left: -1988px;">AIIM  research looks at how less paper in the workplace delivers significant  benefits.  - See more at:  http://www.aiim.org/events/paper-free-day#sthash.G8H80BPA.dpuf</div>\r\n<h2>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be pragmatic</h2>\r\n<p>Paper remains the best tool for some jobs and sometimes a piece of paper is the  best way to capture and/or share information.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are many systems and complimentary technologies on the market that can capture and digitise data  from paper.

Gaining control of print and copy has been proven to create serious financial savings whilst cutting waste and reducing your carbon footprint. Arena''s Sean McGuigan outlines 7 simple steps that can lead to significant savings.', '<p class="introduction">In today&rsquo;s tough market, housing associations must focus on the efficiencies that they can influence to deliver cost savings. Gaining control of print and copy has been proven to create serious financial savings whilst cutting waste and reducing your carbon footprint. Arena''s Sean McGuigan outlines 7 simple steps that can lead to significant savings.</p>\r\n<h2>Review your strategy</h2>\r\n<p>A print and copy strategy with guidelines for staff to follow can be hugely beneficial. From preventing sensitive documents from being left on a printer to enforcing defaults that restrict colour or single-sided printing, a considered approach can deliver multiple benefits. Conscious efforts to change wasteful practices will also nurture a more considerate workforce and lead to greener behaviour.</p>\r\n<p>Julie Greenland, ICT Project Manager of Liverpool Mutual Homes comments; <em class="font_blue">&ldquo;we are seeing a change in behaviour as our staff become more aware of what they are printing. Previously many of them simply didn&rsquo;t know how to change the settings so automating everything has really helped.&rdquo;</em> These new behaviours have had a dramatic effect on print and copy costs; <span class="font_blue">&ldquo;</span><em class="font_blue">We have reduced paper consumption by 40% and our colour usage has reduced from 75% to around 25%.&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n<h2>Print audit</h2>\r\n<p>Whether your contract is close to expiring or not, a print audit is a worthwhile undertaking. In fact, if your print and copy contract is within six months of expiry then we would strongly recommend an audit. This will help you to specify the best solution for your needs when the time comes.</p>\r\n<p>The audit involves placing some software on your network that will track print and copy output and activity. Installing the software takes a matter of minutes and then it works away in the background &ndash; you won&rsquo;t even notice it&rsquo;s there. After a period of around one month, your print audit provider will present the findings to you. They will suggest any changes you could make to your infrastructure to reduce costs and wasteful activity. Arena offers this service without obligation and free of charge.</p>\r\n<p>Giving yourself at least a month to work through this simple process will clarify your print and copy situation and costs, giving you a baseline to work on improving.</p>\r\n<h2>Managed Print Service (MPS)</h2>\r\n<p>A Managed Print Service always begins with a print audit before proposing areas for improvement. The solution often involves a change to the number, type and position of devices you currently use, placing the ideal number of suitable machines in the most appropriate locations. This means you only have devices where you need them and this alone can have a big impact on costs.</p>\r\n<p>Software monitors toner and replacement cartridges are dispatched when needed. The software also notifies your provider when your machine needs a service &ndash; leaving your employees free to get on with more important tasks.</p>\r\n<p>Walter Leser, IT Manager at Foundation Housing explains; <em class="font_blue">&ldquo;MPS has saved us the time and hassle of ordering and stocking toner and we no-longer need to monitor our devices to spot maintenance issues. All of this is done automatically which means our machines are rarely out of service.&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, with MPS your printer maintenance, toner and imaging costs are consolidated in a regular itemised bill from your provider. There are no surprises and costs are transparent for easy budgeting. Often this lowers admin overheads as you are dealing with a single supplier and predictable costs for all purchasing related to print and copy.</p>\r\n<h2>&ldquo;Follow Me&rdquo; Print</h2>\r\n<p>Clever software prevents forgotten pages being left in the printer output tray and tackles wasteful and unnecessary printing as users must visit a printer to release their pages. The risk of confidential documents being left on a printer is reduced, which has obvious security benefits.</p>\r\n<p>Adrian Hall, Head of ICT at Yorkshire Housing, notes; <em class="font_blue">&ldquo;the simple act of requiring employees to visit a printer to release their pages immediately altered their behaviour in a very positive way. Wasted and unnecessary jobs are less common now, and defaults to limit one-sided and colour printing have further fuelled the overall effort."</em></p>\r\n<h2>Print control</h2>\r\n<p>The problem of uncontrolled printing raises various concerns that intelligent print management can address. Print control software increasingly forms the foundation of a Managed Print Service and provides a bucket-load of functionality to control output, keep sensitive documents secure, recover or allocate costs, apply quotas, report on activity and minimise waste.</p>\r\n<p>Print control provides cost transparency, improved document security and greener practices by ensuring that the right documents are printed by the right people at the right time. Add this to MPS and a well thought out print strategy to make print and copy as efficient as possible.</p>\r\n<h2>Framework agreements</h2>\r\n<p>When choosing a new print and copy provider, look for a framework agreement such as those managed by Procurement for Housing (PfH). This saves you the time, cost and effort of going to tender and comparing several providers. An impartial framework provider has done all the hard work for you in order to recommend a preferred supplier.</p>\r\n<h2>Combined approach</h2>\r\n<p>Printing is here to stay, even though volumes may decline, so put the tools in place to let you proactively govern your print infrastructure. Combining tools that monitor, archive and control output with the right mix of hardware, simplified maintenance, &ldquo;just-in-time&rdquo; toner supplies and transparent billing will naturally push costs down. Not only this; a more print aware culture is nurtured, within which employees are far more considerate about what they print.</p>\r\n<p>The next natural step is to consider where paper-led processes can be automated and digitised with the introduction of electronic document and records management (EDRMS). Once this gets underway, serious financial and efficiency savings can be realised, revolutionising your business.</p>\r\n<h3><br />About Sean McGuigan</h3>\r\n<p><img src="../../../assets/articles/171/contained_images/b180e630ff10_245_SEAN-MCGUIGAN.jpg?1383045240" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" align="left" /></p>\r\n<p>Business Development Manager<br />Tel: 0844 863 8000 | Email: <a href="mailto:SeanM@arenagroup.net">SeanM@arenagroup.net</a></p>\r\n<p>Sean joined the Arena Group in 2010, he specialises in print and copy  management, Managed  Print Services (MPS) and electronic document  management (EDM).

So just take the obvious precautions.&nbsp; Be aware of your environment and how you might be exposed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class="font_blue" style="text-align: center;"><em>You wouldn&rsquo;t leave your wallet out on the edge of a table at a coffee shop, so don&rsquo;t do it with your smartphone either.</em></p>\r\n<p>A second physical security consideration is how much valuable and confidential data do you have on the device itself?&nbsp; Should you have that much?&nbsp; Can you avoid downloading data to the device?&nbsp; As 3G is getting more universal, we are closing in on a time when we will have access from anywhere &ndash; so you could have no data on the devices you&rsquo;re carrying around, just accessing corporate systems.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>But in the meantime, have you done anything to protect the data which is on your mobile devices?&nbsp; Some things to consider are encryption of the hard drive on your laptop (e.g. Windows BitLocker) and lock codes on devices.&nbsp; You may also want to get one of the &ldquo;remote wipe&rdquo; tools which are available for smart phones and tablets.&nbsp; It won&rsquo;t help to get your kit back if the worst should happen &ndash; but at least your corporate data won&rsquo;t fall into the wrong hands.</p>\r\n<p class="font_blue" style="text-align: center;"><em>Lost and stolen laptops are one of main causes of fines issued by the Information Commissioner''s Office. Taking reasonable precautions against theft &ndash; including encryption &ndash; is simply not optional.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<h2>Open WiFi &ndash; some problems</h2>\r\n<p>So, assuming that your kit hasn&rsquo;t been stolen, how else might someone get at your data?&nbsp; To understand this, first we need to know a bit about how WiFi works.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>To display web pages, received e-mails and communication with corporate systems, your laptop uses WiFi to send and receive &ldquo;packets&rdquo; of information.&nbsp; These packets are sent between your laptop and the WiFi hub via radio waves. &nbsp;&nbsp;And like any radio signal, these packets can be received by anyone who tunes in to the right frequency.&nbsp; Your laptop only acts on the information which is intended for it, but in fact it &ldquo;hears&rdquo; all of the information flying around<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re in a public space with lots of different devices, it&rsquo;s a bit like everyone shouting messages to each other and your laptop filtering out everything but the bit which is intended for you.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s actually trivial to set a laptop to receive traffic for <em>everyone</em> and this is how hackers start to try to get at your data.&nbsp; So anything sent in &ldquo;clear&rdquo; &ndash; i.e. without encryption &ndash; is open to someone else reading it.&nbsp; And whether WiFi is encrypted depends on how the provider has set up their router, although the vast majority are.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>You&rsquo;d think that it would be easy to check if your connection was encrypted &ndash; which it is<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> &ndash; and if so, that you&rsquo;d be safe.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there are ways to break many of the common encryption modes used by WiFi routers &ndash; in some cases this might take a few hours, but it can be done &ndash; and then the eavesdropper can capture your data.</p>\r\n<p class="font_blue" style="text-align: center;"><em>The main thing to know about WiFi is that your packets of information are being transmitted to anyone who is in range of the WiFi transceiver in your laptop, and who cares to listen.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<h2>Man-in-the-middle (or ''MITM'')</h2>\r\n<p>I mentioned there that <em>many </em>encryption set-ups can be cracked and that it may take a while.&nbsp; Being realistic, this probably won&rsquo;t be the case at the particular hotspot you&rsquo;re using &ndash; it&rsquo;s just not worth the effort on the part of the hacker.&nbsp; A much simpler way to trap you is the &ldquo;man-in-the-middle&rdquo; attack.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Conceptually, this would work as follows.&nbsp; A hacker goes into the coffee shop and gets the password to join their network.&nbsp; He/She then sets up their laptop to act as a WiFi hotspot, using the same password and with a name quite similar to the real one (maybe they&rsquo;d call it &ldquo;Shop Free WiFi&rdquo; if the real one is called &ldquo;Shop WiFi&rdquo;).&nbsp; You then come along and try to make a connection &ndash; picking my router instead of the real one. Your laptop and mine make a secure and encrypted connection and the hacker makes an onward connection via the real router.&nbsp; The situation is now that all your traffic flows through the hacker''s laptop.&nbsp; The key point is that your laptops have made an encrypted connection, which the hacker can decrypt at will<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a>.&nbsp; The hacker is the &ldquo;man-in-the-middle&rdquo;, reading your data, but you think you&rsquo;ve made an encrypted network connection &hellip; you have of course, just not to the intended source!</p>\r\n<p>Incidentally, don&rsquo;t assume that you&rsquo;re safe if you&rsquo;re using a <em>wired</em> network &ndash; such as in a hotel room.&nbsp; A technique with the scary-sounding name of <em>''ARP poisoning''</em> works in much the same way.</p>\r\n<p class="font_blue" style="text-align: center;"><em>Know the name of the WiFi router you should connect to. If you find more than one similar sounding name, check again.&nbsp; The staff may even be interested to know that some new networks have appeared.</em></p>\r\n<h2>Some solutions - HTTPS and VPN</h2>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s all been doom and gloom so far &ndash; you might start to think that there is no way to use a public internet connection safely.&nbsp; Well, it&rsquo;s not quite that bad and there are some things you can do to mitigate these problems.</p>\r\n<p>The different exploits described above rely on the ability of an attacker to make sense of traffic as it passes by, from your device to the eventual destination.&nbsp; But what if the data is encrypted in some other way, before it even leaves your laptop? And then only decrypted when it reaches the (intended) destination?&nbsp; If your laptop and the destination have established some form of encryption &ndash; privately and unique to this particular session &ndash; the eavesdropper can&rsquo;t make sense of the data.&nbsp; This foils even the MITM attack, as even though the attacker has broken the <em>transport </em>encryption, they still only get to see data in an encrypted form.</p>\r\n<p class="font_blue" style="text-align: center;"><em>There are 2 techniques to do this &ndash; HTTPS for websites and VPN for accessing your corporate network.</em></p>\r\n<h3>Secure Websites - HTTPS</h3>\r\n<p>Secure websites use HTTPS as the transport protocol, instead of the standard plain HTTP.&nbsp; You can see this in your browser, as the address for the web page will start with https://.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The system relies on certificates which are issued to the website provider.&nbsp; The certificate gives you assurance that the website is genuine and your web browser validates this against a <em>certificate authority</em>.&nbsp; There is some complex mathematics behind this but the certification gives you two things &ndash; an assurance that you&rsquo;re talking to who you think you are and some data which your web browser can use to create a encryption unique key.&nbsp; Each end of the connection then knows enough to encrypt the packets of information in a way that <em>only the other end can decrypt</em>.&nbsp; You can then safely use that website, secure in the knowledge that anyone snooping on your WiFi signal can&rsquo;t read your data<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a>.</p>\r\n<h3>Virtual Private Networks - VPN</h3>\r\n<p>If you want to access corporate data or attach your laptop to the corporate network from a remote location, a virtual private network is the best solution.&nbsp; This creates a secure connection from your laptop to the corporate network, with the internet just used as a transport system in between.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Again, the key is that data is encrypted before it leaves your device and can only be decrypted by the VPN &lsquo;gateway&rsquo; at the corporate network end.&nbsp; This gives you the same protection as HTTPS &ndash; a snooper can see the packets of data, but they&rsquo;re encrypted at source and so can&rsquo;t be read.</p>\r\n<p>VPN is typically set up by your corporate IT department.&nbsp; In fact, your corporate network should never be open to outside access without a VPN being used.</p>\r\n<h2>An aside on prime numbers</h2>\r\n<p>Modern cryptography is based on properties of prime numbers &ndash; numbers which are only divisible by themselves and one.&nbsp; The crucial point is that if you multiply two prime numbers together, it is very hard to work back from the result to figure out what those prime numbers were.&nbsp; This is sometimes likened to &ldquo;secret paint mixing&rdquo; &ndash; it&rsquo;s easy to mix paint colours, but impossible to separate them again.&nbsp; The best currently known algorithms to find prime factors of a large number rely on lots of guessing and the computing power required to do this increases hugely as the numbers get bigger<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So, if two parties know a couple of large prime numbers, they can pass the <em>result of the multiplication</em> between them without worrying that anyone can get back to the original primes.&nbsp; This is the fundamental of what is called <em>public key cryptography</em> and the basis of how two parties can create a secure connection over an unsecure (unknown) link.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Of course, as computing power is ever increasing, the problem of <em>factoring</em> the product of two large primes becomes more vulnerable to a &ldquo;brute force&rdquo; try-every-value attack.&nbsp; So the prime numbers used are big &ndash; really, really big.&nbsp; This is why you see &ldquo;256-bit&rdquo; encryption talked about &ndash; the 256 refers to the number of digits in the binary representation of the values being used.&nbsp; 1024-bit and 2048-bit are becoming increasing common key lengths.</p>\r\n<h2>Some final basic points to remember</h2>\r\n<p>The HTTPS and VPN tools rely on your laptop or device establishing a connection to a network or website and all traffic leaving your laptop being encrypted.&nbsp; But this is no use at all if your laptop is already compromised in some way.&nbsp; (This next bit applies anywhere, not just out-and-about).</p>\r\n<p>The ideal situation for a hacker is to have some software running on your laptop and there are a few ways to achieve this.&nbsp; Firstly, if you don&rsquo;t have a firewall configured, your laptop can be attacked directly whenever it is connected to a public network (you&rsquo;re probably OK on the corporate LAN which will have firewalls already).&nbsp; Fortunately, most computers are now protected by default.&nbsp; The second approach is to get you to run a program which installs a virus, Trojan or other piece of spyware.&nbsp; This is typically done with &ldquo;social exploits&rdquo;

Gary comments; &ldquo;In the cases where proposed measures towards certification have been applied the benefits to the client in terms of efficiency improvement and cost reduction have been striking.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Similarly, Arena has found that alignment with the standard is already crucial in the public sector, for example in education, which is subject to increasingly stringent legislation regarding the safeguarding of data pertaining to young and vulnerable people. Neil comments; &ldquo;We have doubled our customer base for <strong>m</strong>store over the past two years and BS10008 is often a key concern for the customers we work with.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>In the New Year, Agenci and Arena plan to host a special workshop event in Leeds city centre to present the requirements of BS10008, and options for compliance.

If you would be interested in attending, please contact <a href="mailto:marketing@arenagroup.net">marketing@arenagroup.net</a>.</p>\r\n<h2>What is BS10008?</h2>\r\n<p><br />BS10008 is the&nbsp;British Standard&nbsp;for &ldquo;evidential weight and&nbsp;legal admissibility of&nbsp;electronic information.&rdquo; Introduced in 2008, this standard outlines the&nbsp;specific requirements for the implementation&nbsp;and operation of electronic information management systems.</p>\r\n<p>The standard covers&nbsp;the storage and transfer of information, and addresses issues relating to&nbsp;its authenticity and integrity.&nbsp;<em><span class="font_blue">These issues are&nbsp;important where the information might be used as evidence.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>What are the benefits of BS10008 certification?</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Improved data security</li>\r\n<li>Increased efficiency</li>\r\n<li>Reduced bureaucracy</li>\r\n<li>Reduced operating costs</li>\r\n<li>Reduced reliance on paper</li>\r\n<li>Improved front line services</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Reducing your reliance on paper and digitising processes can save ten&rsquo;s of thousands per year and brings a host of other benefits including increased efficiency, better customer service and increased office space - no more filing cabinets! Certification to BS10008 goes further to ensure that your records can still be used as evidence, should the need arise. This is imperative for many sectors including law, insurance, health and education.</p>\r\n<p>Government and business are increasingly looking to achieve the &lsquo;less paper office&rsquo; in order to reduce costs and improve process efficiencies in the face of tough economic times. Furthermore, technology and the way we consume and work with data is rapidly evolving - there is a growing desire for digital information but this makes data protection a priority concern. 2014/15 will see the introduction of new EU wide Data Protection laws, making this standard even more important. In sectors ranging from health, with the introduction of the electronic medical record, to law, as the government pushes for a paperless court system; the controls over data are key to the delivery of a secure service and protecting personal data.</p>\r\n<h2>Further information</h2>\r\n<p><a href="../../../page/electronic-document-management">More about <strong>m</strong>store</a></p>\r\n<p>More about Agenci: <strong><a href="http://www.theagenci.com/bs10008" target="_blank">http://www.theagenci.com/bs10008</a></strong></p>', '2013-11-22', 'iStock_000015959628Medium.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 174538, '2013-11-22 14:23:52', 'BSi10008', '2013-11-22 14:17:18', '2014-10-08 11:56:30', 3, NULL, 0, NULL, 1, 0, NULL, 'arena-and-agenci-offer-a-one-stop-compliance-shop-for-straight-forward-information-security'),

First up is a Service Apprentice.', '<p class="introduction">"It&rsquo;s really encouraging to see former apprentices doing well in the  field; I know that, if I work hard, I have a good chance to succeed as  well."</p>\r\n<p><strong>When I finished school I knew that I didn&rsquo;t want to be sitting down behind a desk all day so I did an IT apprenticeship. Whilst I was there, Pete (my manager at Arena) came to give us a talk about the service apprenticeship role at Arena and I realised that it was something I could really enjoy doing.</strong></p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m based at Arena&rsquo;s Garforth workshop with other apprentices. It&rsquo;s a fun environment as we all get on well &mdash; there&rsquo;s lots of banter and we see each other out of work time too. The learning is really hands on; we spend so much time repairing and reconditioning machines that it becomes second nature. If I&rsquo;m struggling I just ask Pete and he explains how the problem has occurred and how to avoid it in the future. Because there are a few of us though, we quite often figure out how to solve faults between us, without Pete&rsquo;s help.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>We receive training ranging from IT qualifications at college to learning about new machines on special courses hosted by manufacturers. That&rsquo;s what I like here; we get lots of variety and we&rsquo;re always moving forwards. I&rsquo;ve been on eight training courses since I started here in late 2011.</p>\r\n<p>After a few months you get assigned a mentor. This is a Service <br /> Engineer who started off as an apprentice. Going to visit the customers with my mentor is my favourite part of the job; the challenges are so different to being in the workshop and you never know what to expect.</p>\r\n<p>We also have individual responsibilities; a few of us check second hand machines to decide whether to scrap them for parts, refurbish them or sell them straight on to a reseller. Other apprentices have tasks like preparing parts for engineers in the field.</p>\r\n<p>I recently spent three months working away on a large installation spread over many sites from Southampton to Livingstone. I stayed in hotels through the week, travelling back home on a Friday. I was there with two other apprentices and an engineer; Arena seem to like sending us on the larger installs for the experience of being out in the field, supporting the engineers and wider service team &mdash; Arena&rsquo;s whole ethos is very much &ldquo;in it together&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>Eventually I want to manage my own team of engineers but for now the next step is to become a Service Engineer, out on the road and fixing machines on customer sites. We are awarded points based on our performance and being at the top of the points table when a vacancy comes up gives you a much better chance of getting a position as an engineer. As an added bonus, whoever is top of the table at the end of the year is invited, along with their partner, to join high achievers from throughout the company for the Premier Conference - a long weekend away in a sunny overseas location.</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s really encouraging to see former apprentices doing well in the field; I know that, if I work hard, I have a good chance to succeed as well.</p>\r\n<p class="introduction">Tom</p>\r\n<p><strong>For more information about our apprenticeship programme, or to see how to apply, view our <a href="../../../page/apprenticeship-programme">Apprenticeship Academy page.</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Other articles in this series:</strong></p>\r\n<p><a href="../../../articles/181">Administration Apprentice</a></p>\r\n<p><a href="../../../articles/182">IT Apprentice<strong>&nbsp;</strong></a><strong><br /></strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', '2014-03-03', 'IMG_0192.JPG', 'image/jpeg', 119725, '2014-01-17 15:15:45', '', '2014-01-17 15:15:55', '2014-10-08 11:56:30', 7, NULL, 0, NULL, 1, 0, NULL, 'a-day-in-the-life-service-apprentice'),

I had expected to stay there but a friend told me about the apprenticeship vacancy at Arena. The opportunity to train and earn a qualification whilst working made it an attractive move for me.</strong></p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve never worked in this type of business environment before, so being an apprentice is really good experience. A role like this is all about learning and means that I can get a really good understanding of the way a commercial business operates.</p>\r\n<p>When I first started here I received training from my manager, Sandra; she gave me responsibility for a few tasks and the guidance I needed to get started. Since then my role has really grown.</p>\r\n<p>I make sure that any changes to customer contracts are smoothly administered and I set up new deals on the system. This can be as simple as adding information about a new machine against an existing account or entering details for a brand new customer. I&rsquo;m often contacting leasing companies or customers to ensure that we all have access to up-to-date information.</p>\r\n<p>I also work closely with Arena&rsquo;s Admin Assistant, Debbie, liaising with customers and Arena&rsquo;s Sales and Service teams to collate information in preparation for installations. Debbie is training me to support her during really busy times, and to cover her role when she is away.</p>\r\n<p>Another of my regular tasks is recording customer feedback gathered by our Customer Relationship Management Team (CRMs). The CRMs visit our customers to ensure that they are satisfied with the service they are receiving from Arena, and they gather lots of useful feedback. This all goes into a database and I save individual surveys into <strong>m</strong>store before sending letters to customers to thank them for taking the time to offer us their feedback.</p>\r\n<p>Outside of my day-to-day role I also help with invoices and leases along with binding proposals for the Sales team. I also work on reception when our receptionist is away, manning the switchboard and welcoming guests. I quite enjoy that &ndash; it was quite daunting at first because the switchboard can be incredibly busy, but now I know what I&rsquo;m doing it makes a nice change from being in the office.</p>\r\n<p>The work I do is incredibly varied and the people I work with really make my job enjoyable. I get a lot of support from colleagues in the Finance and Admin teams&ndash; and Sandra is always available if I have any questions. There&rsquo;s a great atmosphere in the office and we all get along; I&rsquo;ve made a lot of good friends and we spend time together in and out of work. The social events have really made me feel part of the team from the very beginning.</p>\r\n<p>Alongside my role I&rsquo;m studying for a Business NVQ at Wakefield College. I have assignments to do outside of work and lecturers from the college also visit Arena to observe the work I&rsquo;m doing.</p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about the future but for now I&rsquo;m happy to be in a role that I enjoy whilst getting a qualification and developing skills that I know will be useful in whatever challenge I take on next.</p>\r\n<p class="introduction">Evie</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>For more information about our apprenticeship programme, or to see how to apply, view our <a href="../../../page/apprenticeship-programme">Apprenticeship Academy page.</a></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Other articles in this series:</strong></p>\r\n<p><a href="../../../articles/180">Service Apprentice<br /></a></p>\r\n<p><a href="../../../articles/182">IT Apprentice<strong> </strong></a><strong><br /></strong></p>', '2014-03-03', '0803.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 215642, '2014-03-03 10:32:23', '', '2014-01-22 13:38:50', '2014-10-08 11:56:30', 7, NULL, 0, NULL, 1, 0, NULL, 'a-day-in-the-life…-administration-apprentice'),

Also, alongside this, Arena is helping me to gain my Microsoft qualifications.</p>\r\n<p>Although I had previously studied IT at college, IT in the working environment is completely different. I was pretty much a clean slate when I arrived which I think has made it easier for Steve, my manager, to teach me.</p>\r\n<p>There are just the two of us in the IT office. We get on well; working hard but have a laugh as well. Because of the nature of my job I also spend a lot of time with various members of staff around the company. I&rsquo;m often travelling between Arena&rsquo;s various sites; it&rsquo;s good to be out and about, visiting colleagues that I wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise see.</p>\r\n<p>My job is very varied; I&rsquo;m responsible for setting up phones, laptops and door fobs for new employees. I also order new equipment such as software and computer parts, and I provide some support to internal users of MS Dynamics, our sales database.</p>\r\n<p>The main target that I am measured by is the quality of my responses to IT tickets, or queries, from staff - I must respond to at least 80% of these personally. I get all sorts of problems to solve through this which provides the satisfaction in my role.

(184, 'Future-proofing a large document archive', 'Common challenges surrounding the retention of information for a very long time, and the considerations worth making before you digitise a large paper archive.', '<p class="introduction">A look at the challenges surrounding the retention of information for a very long time, and the considerations worth making before you digitise a large paper archive.</p>\r\n<p>Several of our previous articles advise on how to catalogue data and what should &ndash; or should not &ndash; be retained.&nbsp; In some cases, the legal retention period for a document is measured in decades, making a major issue of the decisions you take around storage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are two challenges in keeping information for a very long time.&nbsp; Firstly, it has to be safe from loss or damage.&nbsp; Secondly, it has to be usable if and when you do want to look at it again.</p>\r\n<h2>Paper Challenges</h2>\r\n<p>As a technology company, we are advocates of electronic document records management systems &ndash; <strong>EDRMS</strong> &ndash; in place of paper stores.&nbsp; Usually, EDRM systems are promoted on the grounds of better security, accessibility and efficiency. However, these systems also bring a big advantage over keeping key information in paper format:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Whenever paper files are moved or handled, they are at risk of loss, serious damage or mild degradation. </li>\r\n<li>Paper also degrades in storage - picture dusty yellowed pages held together by rusted paperclips.&nbsp; </li>\r\n<li>Some types of printed or hard copy documents are particularly sensitive, such as thermal print material, which we''ve seen degrade significantly in as little as 5 years &ndash; and become totally illegible within 10 years.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>If you are keeping critical information on paper then you are unlikely to know its condition until you try to retrieve it - and that might be when you need to defend a legal case.</p>\r\n<p>The message here is obviously to carefully plan how you store hard copy documents if you need to archive them for many years. We would always recommend an EDRMS to safeguard your information from damage, degradation and disasters such as floods.</p>\r\n<h2>Electronic Solutions &hellip; and Challenges</h2>\r\n<p>Digitising your paper solves the physical degradation issue but electronic systems require their own considerations.</p>\r\n<p>Firstly, you&rsquo;ll need some software to handle your digital files.&nbsp; If you just go with &ldquo;files on disk&rdquo; then you have some immediate considerations:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Finding what you want, when you want it: </strong>Think carefully about file structure and how you will manage disposal of documents at the end of their retention period.</li>\r\n<li><strong>How to keep sensitive files secure:</strong> This solution won&rsquo;t have granular security or auditing.&nbsp; Someone could delete or replace part of your archive and you won&rsquo;t have automatic assurance against file tampering. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Consider file types: </strong>Currently it can be a challenge to open an AmiPro word processing file or even a Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet file &ndash; both common formats 15 years ago. </li>\r\n<li><strong>A robust storage media:</strong> There is a risk that your disc(s) will become corrupted or damaged, making your files inaccessible.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>A good EDRMS addresses these problems, but there are some key questions to ask your provider:</p>\r\n<h3>Some documents must be retained for many years and may outlive your means of opening them (your EDRMS).</h3>\r\n<p>Like any other business purchase, you should consider the solution lifecycle and what you&rsquo;ll do at the end of that useful life. &nbsp;You may also ask about the future plans for your chosen EDRMS.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>So, if your EDRMS does become obsolete, can you extract, open and read the files stored within it - and move them to a new system?</h3>\r\n<p>This is pretty much covered with scanned images &ndash; the formats are well  understood and commonly used.&nbsp; I may live to regret this, but I would  expect to be able to read a CCITT Group4 compressed TIFF file with  standard software 30+ years from now.</p>\r\n<h3>What about older digital formats, such as AmiPro or  Lotus?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p>Well, you could convert these to Word and Excel but that risks  those products also being out-competed. In this case you would have to  migrate again &hellip; and again.&nbsp; At each conversion, you risk the file  changing &ndash; for example, the fonts used in the original may not be  available and an approximation will have to be made.</p>\r\n<p>The solution may be PDF/A format, a particular version of the Adobe PDF standard which is  designed for archiving. This subset is designed (and defined in  ISO19005-1:2005) to correctly  display the information held in that PDF/A file &ndash; without any external  dependencies.&nbsp; This would include the fonts required in that document,  so the information is always going to look as the author intended it.&nbsp;  The PDF/A specification is bound to also evolve over time and you may  need to perform some migrations, but you can be certain that you&rsquo;re  keeping the original appearance of the document. So use of PDF/A is  another question to be asking your software supplier. Your EDRMS can then provide the access control and traceability, whilst storing files in a form which will be accessible with you need them.</p>\r\n<h3>Hardware</h3>\r\n<p>On the subject of obsolete technology, it&rsquo;s also worth mentioning storage media at this point.&nbsp; Maybe 10 or so years ago, the storage technology of choice for archiving was something called &ldquo;write once optical media&rdquo; &ndash; or WORM drive. These sounded great, because the media was specified to last for at least 50 years - great for long term archiving.</p>\r\n<p>The problem was, the drives clearly weren&rsquo;t going to last that long, and there were compatibility issues with PCs used to control those drives. This mix of compatibility issues left no standard format for the data on disc and we found that customers needed to migrate all their data to new discs every 5 years, so that they knew they could read the data reliably. So much for 50 years of media life ...</p>\r\n<p>Now that the market has moved on, this technology is obsolete and pretty much everyone uses arrays of magnetic storage instead. But this is a hard-won lesson to guard against manufacturer-specific hardware, however well-intentioned the design may be. Your platform choice should allow growth and migration at a sensible cost.</p>\r\n<h2>Summary</h2>\r\n<p>Long term document retention is a matter of planning for the future. It is notoriously difficult to predict future events and requirements but there are a couple of basic rules which can avoid major trouble and expense:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Select a solution that supports whatever you put into your archive on the first day, making it usable on the last day &ndash; without degradation or expensive maintenance work.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Plan for the day when the system will need replacement and consider how you will transfer your archived data to the next system. This is going to happen many times as technology advances throughout the lifetime of your information archive.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>About Neil Maude</h3>\r\n<p><img src="../../assets/articles/113/contained_images/8d9e8419f6d7_180_NeilM_ws.jpg?1359557446" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" align="left" /></p>\r\n<p>Electronic Document Management General Manager<br />Tel: 0844 863 8000 | Email: <a href="mailto:neilM@arenagroup.net">neilM@arenagroup.net</a></p>\r\n<p>Neil joined the Arena Group in 2006 and has almost 20 years of   experience in the electronic document management industry, working with   both private and public sector customers.&nbsp; Neil sits on Arena&rsquo;s board  of  directors and manages the delivery operations of Arena&rsquo;s EDM  business.&nbsp;  His team spend their time developing software, implementing  solutions  for customers and providing after-sales software support  services, both  in the UK and internationally.</p>\r\n<h2>Related Features</h2>\r\n<p><a href="../../../articles/163">Confidential files left on trains, in the wrong hands, on the move?</a></p>\r\n<p><a href="../../../page/electronic-document-management" target="_blank"><strong>m</strong>store, software for document management</a></p>\r\n<p><a href="../../../case_studies?service=Electronic+Document+Management" target="_blank">Case studies: <strong>m</strong>store in practice</a></p>', '2014-01-23', 'iStock_000033885734Medium.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 400735, '2014-01-28 09:59:49', 'Document Archive', '2014-01-23 17:20:19', '2015-03-31 14:55:45', 3, 3, 0, NULL, 1, 0, NULL, 'future-proofing-a-large-document-archive'),

Investment in the green agenda has, perhaps understandably, taken a back seat for many and its resurgence is surely a sign of recovery. One business making serious strides in this area is Morrish Solicitors LLP.</p>\r\n<p>An office move by <a href="http://www.morrishsolicitors.com/" target="_blank">Morrish Solicitors LLP</a> saw the introduction of low energy lighting, recycling of old hardware from the previous site and company policies refreshed to acknowledge the environment. Perhaps the biggest move towards a greener operation though, is evident in the practice&rsquo;s print and copy strategy.</p>\r\n<p>Morrish renewed a contract with Arena Group Ltd to replace its printers and copiers with upgraded machines. New Toshiba models were chosen for their low energy consumption and for the fact that they are carbon offset. This means that the CO2 produced in their manufacture and transport, and the estimated print and copy output for the contract period, has been offset with a contribution towards a carbon reduction initiative. In this case, it funds energy efficient cooking stoves in Africa under a scheme coordinated by carbon offsetting expert, co2balance. Through this process the emissions are balanced to become "Carbon Zero" with no detrimental effect on the environment. Morrish went a step further, purchasing additional credits from co2balance to carbon neutralise its Kyocera machines under the same scheme.</p>\r\n<p>Paul Scholey, Partner at Morrish Solicitors, comments; &ldquo;every business has a responsibility to keep its carbon footprint to a minimum.&nbsp;To really walk the walk you need to look at all of your buying decisions with that in mind &ndash; it&rsquo;s an approach we&rsquo;re trying to adopt across the board, and we&rsquo;re sure that our clients approve.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t have to cost an arm and a leg to be proactive with your CSR policies.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The output of the machines has also been considered from an environmental perspective. Defaults on the printers are set to reduce wasteful and unnecessary print practices, limiting colour output and one-sided pages. This minimises paper consumption and ensures economic use of toner whilst preventing Morrish&rsquo;s recycling bins from over-flowing. This is not only environmentally aware but has a positive impact on the financial cost of running the machines.</p>\r\n<p>Jaime Lockwood, IT Manager at Morrish adds; &ldquo;In today&rsquo;s economic and environmental climate, just being good at what we do is not enough.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s our social responsibility to ensure that we are also as environmentally aware as possible.

Arena Group’s Professional Services Manager, Ian Fox, shares his advice on how best to keep track of your organisation’s supplies whilst safeguarding your budgets.', '<p class="introduction">A few high profile court cases have recently made the headlines, following fraud convictions against individuals ordering excess amounts of printer toner and ink &ndash; in one case, even buying supplies for printers their employer did not own &ndash; and selling it online. This activity went on for several years, earning the culprit an estimated &pound;90k before a small mistake prompted suspicion and uncovered the fraud.</p>\r\n<p>Although this is unlikely to be a widespread issue, many businesses have no way of tracking their consumption of such items, so it can be easy for corrupt behaviour to go on undetected. This is especially the case for businesses stocking large amounts of toner in an effort to ensure they never run out.</p>\r\n<h2>Do you have a store room full of toner and consumables?</h2>\r\n<p>Toner is expensive, often costing several hundred pounds to fully stock one printer or multi-function device (that&rsquo;s the big printer, scanner, copier and fax machine sitting in your office). If you own inkjet printers you&rsquo;ll find cartridges are even more expensive; it&rsquo;s a little known fact - although perhaps not surprising; that <a href="../../../articles/107">inkjet ink is more expensive than Dom Perignon champagne</a>!</p>\r\n<p>You might have a stock room full of the stuff, so it&rsquo;s a good basic step to keep an itinerary that details how much is ordered. This will help you to track your consumption and forecast spending. It can also evidence that the right products are purchased and that they are used appropriately.</p>\r\n<h2>Who looks after your printers?</h2>\r\n<p>If you buy your own printers and manage maintenance and related consumables in-house then you are more at risk from underhand behaviour. However, if your printers are leased and managed under a service contract then you benefit from third party protection. This is because you will be ordering consumables from your provider, who will notice if you are requesting more than you need &ndash; and will only supply the appropriate products for your printers. A good provider will endeavour to avoid over-supplying in an effort to manage their own costs.</p>\r\n<h2>Considered a Managed Print Service (MPS)?</h2>\r\n<p>This is the ultimate weapon in your armoury against over-spending on print and copy. Your printers will be managed by a service provider who will bundle your machines, consumables and service together into one, agreed, regular bill. So, - no more surprises!</p>\r\n<p>Even better, your machine will send an automatic alert to your provider when it is running low on toner &ndash; and you&rsquo;ll receive a new cartridge &lsquo;just in time&rsquo;. This means there is no need for anyone to spend time sourcing and ordering your consumables, and you don&rsquo;t need to keep a big stock on-site.</p>\r\n<p>Taking this a step further, installing print control software on your machines will afford you an even greater degree of transparency and control. This lets you report on exactly what is printed, by whom and at what cost, and gives you additional tools to control user activity. <a href="../../../articles/112">Read more about print control in my related article</a>.</p>\r\n<p>So, regardless of the size of your business or the way you manage your printers, there are ways to manage your stock and spending on consumables.</p>\r\n<h3>About Ian Fox</h3>\r\n<p><img src="../../..//assets/articles/200/contained_images/21ef27b5b1bc_276_Ian Fox Jan15 large.jpg?1422352750" border="0" alt="" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="131" height="131" align="LEFT" />Professional Services Manager<br />Tel: 0800 863 8000 | Email: <a href="mailto:ianF@arenagroup.net"></a><a href="mailto:ianf@arenagroup.net">IanF@arenagroup.net</a></p>\r\n<p>Ian Fox joined the Arena Group as a Systems Engineer in 1995.

Arena''s Gary Putson takes a look at the benefits of outsourcing your print and copy management. ', '<p class="introduction">Outsourcing is contracting a business function to an external party. Arena''s <strong>Gary Putson</strong> takes a look at the benefits of outsourcing your print and copy management.</p>\r\n<h2>Source expert support and resources</h2>\r\n<p>A specialist company will have the latest information on new software and hardware at its fingertips, offering you assurance that you will always have access to the best equipment to drive down costs and increase efficiencies in your business.</p>\r\n<p>Your provider&rsquo;s specialist team will be able to pass on the benefits from the latest training in both machine care and software, without the expense or time out needed for your staff to do any learning or research themselves.</p>\r\n<h2>Shine a light on areas for improvement and cost reduction</h2>\r\n<p>At the outset, an external company will assess your workforce&rsquo;s print and copy behaviour to report on costs and any inefficiencies that they can address. This initial investigation is without obligation to purchase anything. The provider will look at a broad array of things including which machines are most heavily used, associated energy consumption, the types of documents printed and so on, in addition to considering how to improve the maintenance of your devices, increase efficiency and cut costs. A comprehensive report is delivered to you with a proposed plan of action.</p>\r\n<h2>From installation, to support and maintenance &ndash; everything is taken care of</h2>\r\n<p>After installing a new system for you, consumables for your printers can be managed by your provider. Remote monitoring software means the end of ordering replacement toner as a new cartridge is despatched just as a current one is running out. This also means you no-longer need to store a supply of toner in your office.</p>\r\n<p>The machines themselves can also be monitored remotely so that engineers can arrive at your premises having already gathered information about the problem &ndash; leading to a quicker fix. Taking up a managed print service (MPS) means simplified billing too &ndash; as maintenance, consumables and printing are covered in one, regular, fixed cost.</p>\r\n<h2>Focus on your Core Business</h2>\r\n<p>Every business has finite resources and every employee has limited time. Outsourcing your print and copy management allows employees to stay focussed on core business needs rather than having their time taken up elsewhere.</p>\r\n<h2>Quickly Implement New Technology</h2>\r\n<p>Most managers will be able to give you a list of projects that they believe would greatly add value but will take significant resources, time and energy to implement. Often, a review of print and copy infrastructure falls into this category &ndash; we know it can deliver cost savings and efficiency benefits but the project itself can seem daunting. Outsourcing is a way to access the resources and expertise to make this innovation happen, removing the time consuming tasks of planning and implementation, hiring new people, or training existing staff by bringing in a qualified and experienced external team.</p>\r\n<h2>Improve performance</h2>\r\n<p>With one expert to oversee all of your print and copy requirements and resources, you can be certain that your infrastructure will be managed efficiently. At the outset your provider will audit your current situation and implement a plan to suit your business needs. Going forward their guidance and a dedicated service team will ensure that machines are kept well maintained and up to date, minimising down time.</p>\r\n<p>Often the alternative can involve different departments managing their own needs &ndash; which leads to uncontrolled costs, or an internal IT team that is run off its feet and unable to spend time on innovation.</p>\r\n<h3>About Gary Putson</h3>\r\n<p><img src="../../../assets/articles/207/contained_images/c03ee1fdd368_266_Gary Putson 0613.JPG?1404137254" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" align="left" /></p>\r\n<p>Group Sales Manager<br />Tel: 0800 863 8000 | Email: <a href="mailto:garyP@arenagroup.net">garyP@arenagroup.net</a></p>\r\n<p>Gary has worked with Arena for 8 years and has a long background in  sales, originating in the telecoms sector.

When we ask them why, we tend to hear a common set of reasons for clinging on to heavily paper-driven processes. This article summarises the top 10 excuses and the reasons why they need to be fed through the shredder.</span></p>\r\n<h2>1. We&rsquo;ve always used paper records &ndash; what&rsquo;s the problem?</h2>\r\n<ol> </ol>\r\n<p>This is, without doubt, the most frequently voiced reason we hear for clinging to paper. Change can seem daunting and it&rsquo;s often painful and challenging. It&rsquo;s always easier to stay put but sticking with broken and outdated processes is a recipe for failure. Such an unwillingness to consider change inevitably leads to an exponential rise in paper usage, storage needs and costs.</p>\r\n<h2>2. I don&rsquo;t trust computers</h2>\r\n<ol> </ol>\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve all heard the horror stories about losing important documents when a computer is infected by a virus. No one likes that sinking feeling when a file is lost or corrupted but that is exactly where remote backup tapes, removable hard drives, &lsquo;the cloud&rsquo; or a remote server come in.</p>\r\n<ol> </ol>\r\n<h2>3. Paper is easy to use</h2>\r\n<ol> </ol>\r\n<p>Paper is easy to use when you&rsquo;re working on a particular document, but then what? That document is likely to be added to an ever-expanding paper archive, presenting you with a potential time-consuming challenge the next time you need to retrieve it &ndash; which might be in several years&rsquo; time. The longer you hoard paper, the more documents you&rsquo;ll accrue and the more difficulty you will face in complying with ever-evolving Data Protection guidelines.</p>\r\n<ol> </ol>\r\n<h2>4. We can control security more easily with paper records</h2>\r\n<ol> </ol>\r\n<p>You may lock your sensitive documents away and grant access only to authorised employees. However, can you evidence that only they have accessed those files and that they have not tampered with them or shared them? Human nature dictates that at some point, that document store might be left unlocked and forgotten &ndash; can you prove that has never happened?</p>\r\n<p>An electronic document management system requires users to log in. This lets you control and audit which members of staff can access sensitive information, and prevent them from seeing anything that they are not authorised to view. Good software will gift you a host of security features to track user activity, prevent deletion of files and ensure your documents are protected.</p>\r\n<ol> </ol>\r\n<h2>5. We know where all of our paper records are</h2>\r\n<ol> </ol>\r\n<p>You may be able to keep track today, but as the number of documents stored continues to rise, this will get more and more difficult. Misfiling, malicious activity or, worse still, document loss (through degradation or human error), may go undetected and cause you huge problems.</p>\r\n<p>All it could take to bring your carefully memorised system to its knees could be a crisis, such as a fire or flood - or even some dropped and scattered paperwork. An electronic document management system will prevent the permanent loss of documents whilst indexing and searching functionality places even a misfiled record at your fingertips within a few mouse clicks.</p>\r\n<ol> </ol>\r\n<h2>6. We can&rsquo;t digitise every process for every team, it&rsquo;s impossible</h2>\r\n<ol> </ol>\r\n<p>We hear you! Rome wasn&rsquo;t built in a day and the concept of digitising all of your paper-led processes can seem daunting. It can be done step-by-step, though, very effectively. We often start with a look at just one of your functions &ndash; like finance, or pupil/customer records. Once that&rsquo;s worked out we move on through a pre-defined plan at a pace that suits you.</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s also a good idea to also review the way you print and copy documents at the outset. This is an area where clever technology and a wise infrastructure can reduce paper consumption, address costs and simplify maintenance.</p>\r\n<ol> </ol>\r\n<h2>7. My job will be replaced by a computer</h2>\r\n<ol> </ol>\r\n<p>You may be worried that robots will take over the world &ndash; but that day has not yet arrived. Don&rsquo;t think of an electronic records management as doing your job, rather, think of it as a tool to help you with your job. It can ease and improve the management of digitised records by making it easier to index and find documents, monitor retention and disposal periods and keep information safe through increased security and remote back-ups.</p>\r\n<ol> </ol>\r\n<h2>8. Our paper document archive is not likely to be lost in a crisis &ndash; the risk of a fire, flood or similar is so low that we are willing to take it.</h2>\r\n<ol> </ol>\r\n<p>We have heard this a few times and, I kid you not, at least one of those businesses returned to us some time later having suffered just such a crisis. Bad things do happen, and it&rsquo;s best to protect your critical documents and be prepared.</p>\r\n<h2>9. It&rsquo;s too expensive to go digital</h2>\r\n<ol> </ol>\r\n<p class="p1">Working with paper also incurs large costs, it&rsquo;s just that they are seeping into your bottom line daily, in the form of overheads such as running printers, and purchasing paper. They are also there in the form of inefficient practices that cost you time. For example, you might need to call back customers after retrieving information from paper files in order to answer their queries. You might spend hours searching for a document, filing and retrieving records &ndash; or undertaking your annual archiving process. Even storing a paper document archive incurs costs, and increasingly stringent legislation in some sectors will only frustrate this issue as document retention requirements expand. All of these costs are present, but they are tougher to spot and control &ndash; and they can all be addressed by digitising your processes.</p>\r\n<h2>10.&nbsp; We have to use paper in order to comply with legislation</h2>\r\n<p>This excuse is about as old as a paper filing system. You can make almost every kind of transaction from buying a home to filing taxes without ever signing a physical document. Laws have changed that allow typed and digital signatures; this is now a standard practice and looks like it is here to stay.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', '2014-07-25', 'iStock_000028693036Medium.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 340176, '2014-07-25 07:49:36', 'in tray', '2014-07-25 07:49:38', '2014-10-08 11:56:30', 3, NULL, 0, NULL, 1, 0, NULL, '10-reasons-to-curb-your-paper-addiction'),

Karen explains; &ldquo;I represented a nurse from Wakefield called Nellie Spindler. We all walked in WW1 nurses uniforms to Menin Gate, where we laid wreathes and took some time to reflect and say a few words together in remembrance of those who sacrificed so much for the things we often take for granted today.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>To date, Karen has raised just under &pound;1000.

(216, 'Looking back: 6 Key Changes in Business ', 'Three of Arena’s longest serving staff members tell us how changes in the workplace over the last twenty years have affected them, and the service that Arena provides:', '<h1 class="introduction">Three of Arena&rsquo;s longest serving staff members tell us how changes in the workplace over the last twenty years have affected them, and the service that Arena provides:</h1>\r\n<h2><strong>Improved communication</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Account Manager, John Wall, recalls; &ldquo;We would send thousands of faxes and post promotional leaflets through letter boxes to share information.&rdquo; Email means people can now be contacted almost instantly from anywhere with an internet connection.</p>\r\n<p>Mobile phones have also had a huge effect; &ldquo;When we were out of the office we used pre-pay phone cards in phone boxes. Sometimes I would borrow the customer&rsquo;s phone or head office would call the customer to speak with me.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Remote working</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Mobile phones, tablets and laptops make remote working easy. Arena&rsquo;s Neil Maude comments; &ldquo;With our <strong>m</strong>store system for electronic document management we can even access shared files and collaborate with colleagues whilst we&rsquo;re out of the office &ndash; no more dusty and insecure filing cabinets.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Head of HR, Martin Wright, notes that business is now 24/7; &ldquo;In 1991 we had discrete working hours but with email and business mobile phones, we are always available. Some people even reply to emails when they are on holiday!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Print and copy technology</strong></h2>\r\n<p>The modern MFD is a catch-all for the office and far removed from the stand-alone devices of the early 90s. Logistics Director, Harry Wells, explains; &ldquo;The devices can do everything from printing and scanning, to fax and email.&rdquo; With some clever software we can even connect to them remotely, so individual machines alert us when toner is running low and we can sometimes diagnose mechanical problems from afar. &ldquo;We can efficiently keep machines up-and-running, which is convenient for the customer and straight-forward for us.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Printers have progressed from black and white Dot Matrix machines to laser and Harry is glad of this change; &ldquo;They used to use coated paper which was hard to write on and they&rsquo;d jam every few hundred prints. Now it&rsquo;s all a clean process with no messy inks&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Improved safety is not to be underestimated either. Harry recalls; &ldquo;Some had extinguishers next to them for when they set on fire!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>24/7 service</strong></h2>\r\n<p>John highlights increasing automation; &ldquo;We used to get our meter readings and service requests by phone. With clever software, requests come in automatically. Errors are reduced as we know exactly which toner or part is needed.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Website requests for service and toner may yet take precedence over phone calls &ndash; although many of our customers tell us that they like to chat with our Call Control team. However, the 24-hour presence of the website is beneficial for those who like to get their requests to us out of normal working hours. Martin explains; &ldquo;Customers can send us service calls and toner requests at midnight if they want to, knowing we will pick them up first thing the next day.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Smart new technology also enables Arena&rsquo;s Call Control team to monitor the precise location of our engineers out on the road, meaning that allocating engineers to service calls is more efficient, quicker and easier than ever. Engineers receive jobs remotely on their phone or laptop, and simply get on with their visits.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>The rise and rise of the &lsquo;less paper office&rsquo;</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Internal document processes have evolved through the use of Arena&rsquo;s own products as Martin explains; &ldquo;With our <strong>m</strong>store software, documents are accessible at the touch of a button. Working digitally is extremely efficient, more secure than paper and we always have an accurate audit trail.&rdquo; Previously processes were much slower, documents often got lost and we needed much more storage for all of that paper.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Improved customer relationships</strong></h2>\r\n<p>With a well-managed Customer Relationship Management system, managing communication with customers is much simpler. Client information is held centrally and is shared across our teams, which is vital as our business continues to grow.</p>\r\n<p>John recalls the early 90&rsquo;s. &ldquo;I kept all of my leads in a rolodex that just contained contact details; I had to remember a lot about each customer and it was all in my own head &ndash; not shared with colleagues. Although it&rsquo;s really important to maintain those personal relationships with customers, maintaining a database helps the wider Arena Team to operate in a much more &lsquo;joined up&rsquo; and informed fashion.&rdquo;</p>', '2014-11-05', 'bigstock-Ideas-Technology-in-the-hands-34484432.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 183213, '2014-09-29 11:03:51', '', '2014-09-29 11:03:55', '2014-11-05 09:54:20', 7, 3, 0, NULL, 1, 0, NULL, 'looking-back-6-key-changes-in-business'),

Knowing which machines handle the highest volumes, what percentage of colour is being produced, and where they are located enables us to suggest ways to tweak your infrastructure to gain maximum efficiency. We can even check on the health of your machines and diagnose any mechanical problems remotely. This can all potentially reduce your costs and helps to keep your printers in good working order.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Automated meter readings</strong></h2>\r\n<p>This clever technology takes care of meter readings automatically, sending your provider an accurate reading every 5 hours &ndash; so you don&rsquo;t have to do a thing.</p>\r\n<p><em>"[The software] certainly gives me a better billing experience. In a previous role,&nbsp;monthly readings needed to be submitted,&nbsp;an invoice would arrive and photocopies that were monitored via a spreadsheet would then need to be checked.

(227, 'Is your printer data secure?', 'MFP’s (Multi Function Printers) are often overlooked in an organisation''s security policy. This can be a risk if sensitive data is processed through the machine, but there are solutions available to ensure that private data remains private. Arena’s Ian Fox explains:', '<p class="introduction">From securing IT networks to locking filing cabinets or shredding files when they are no longer required, many businesses are conscious of the importance of document security. Most companies have procedures and regulations in place to ensure that sensitive information does not get into the wrong hands.</p>\r\n<p>When you use your Multi Function Printer(MFP), temporary files may be created on its internal hard disk drive as it caches print, or collates copied or scanned pages. Unfortunately some well publicised cases have made the headlines, where end of life MFP&rsquo;s have been resold and subsequently targeted for the extraction of sensitive data.</p>\r\n<p>Fear not! There are solutions available to ensure that private data remains  private. Below, Arena&rsquo;s Head of Professional Services, Ian Fox,  explains.</p>\r\n<p>We don&rsquo;t need to explain the problem of leaked data reaching the hands of competitors. This alone should provide enough motivation to ensure security but if it doesn&rsquo;t, the Information Commisoner''s Office (ICO) is always on hand to impose financial penalties or prosecute any companies acting in breach of its rules.</p>\r\n<p class="font_blue" style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The ICO can give fines of up to &pound;500,000 for failure to comply with the Data Protection Act.</em></strong></p>\r\n<h2>How to be sure that your MFP data is secure:</h2>\r\n<p>Scans and print jobs are temporarily stored on the MFP&rsquo;s hard drive before being drawn from it to print. In the past, instant overwriting or encryption of data was the only way to address this, often leading to a loss of device performance. The other option was a manual process at the end of the device&rsquo;s life to invalidate the data, either by removing the drive and physically destroying it or by using one of the many utilities / services available for secure erase. Both of these are extremely time consuming processes.</p>\r\n<p>Many modern machines now come with secure hard disk technology as standard. The data on these disks is encrypted using an AES 256-bit key to comply with ISO/IEC15408 standards. The decryption key is known only by the corresponding MFD and, in the event of the disk being connected to any other system, the data is immediately rendered unreadable.</p>\r\n<p>With this type of technology in place it&rsquo;s also possible for an authorised service engineer to enter specific security codes into the device that can instigate destruction of all data held on the disk without the need for removing the disk from the machine. This saves time and ensures security when dealing with your MFP at the end of its contract.</p>\r\n<h3>About Ian Fox</h3>\r\n<p><img src="../../../assets/articles/227/contained_images/1af28acae326_276_Ian Fox Jan15 large.jpg?1422352750" border="0" alt="" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="148" height="148" align="LEFT" /></p>\r\n<p>Professional Services Manager<br />Tel: 0800 863 8000 | Email: <a href="mailto:ianF@arenagroup.net">ianF@arenagroup.net</a></p>\r\n<p>Ian Fox joined the Arena Group as a Systems Engineer in 1995.

Arena''s Ian Fox explains why such drastic action is not necessary and outlines the ways in which many organisations are already tackling the problem.', '<p class="introduction">A <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/mps-push-for-ban-on-long-email-disclaimers-9965802.html?origin=internalSearch">recent article in the Independent</a> included a quote from Sir Alan Duncan, (MP for Rutland and Melton, and a Minister of State in the Department for International Development). He asserts that long disclaimers at the bottom of emails waste &ldquo;forests&rsquo; worth of paper&rdquo; and declares his belief that such disclaimers should be replaced by a simple and short link.</p>\r\n<p>The article makes a very valid point; &ldquo;Printing out emails often means accidentally printing all of the disclaimer at the bottom, which can add up to a number of pages&hellip; Short emails become 2 page documents, longer emails &ndash; and chains &ndash; start to run over multiple sheets. All of which adds to the size of the paper files. So signatures add not only cost in print, but also in long term filing and archiving costs.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Arena&rsquo;s Neil Maude agrees, stating; &ldquo;We run a scanning bureau to digitise paper files; we have frequently found that up to 25% of the file content consists of email signatures.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<h2>An alternative solution (without even touching your disclaimer)</h2>\r\n<p>You may not realise it, but the tools to address this problem already exist and are working within many businesses. Arena&rsquo;s Ian Fox outlines some features of commonly used software that can prevent the accidental printing of email disclaimers and help to reduce the number of pages printed.</p>\r\n<ol> </ol>\r\n<h3>Educate users with alerts</h3>\r\n<ol> </ol>\r\n<p>Much of this wasteful output is produced accidentally. A user goes to print an email, without realising that the email contains many replies and forwards from previous communications. Before they know it several pages are streaming out of their printer, most of which are destined for the recycle bin!</p>\r\n<p>With effective use of print control software, it is possible to generate a pop-up alert to a user, informing them of the number of pages that will be printed and, if required, even the cost to the business of printing the document. These alerts can be configured to your requirements and will of course work with other applications. Once this technology is in place we usually see a substantial reduction in accidental page printing.</p>\r\n<ol> </ol>\r\n<h3>Set appropriate defaults</h3>\r\n<ol> </ol>\r\n<p>Further to alerts, rules-based printing can be used to select more economical defaults. Printing can be set to black and white or greyscale as standard (colour prints are typically ten times more expensive than mono.) You might also default to duplex printing - a sheet of paper costs around half a penny - you&rsquo;ve paid for two sides so why not use them? Printing on both sides of the page can also help reduce your storage and shredding costs.</p>\r\n<ol> </ol>\r\n<h3>Helpful monitoring, duplicate detection and print quotas</h3>\r\n<ol> </ol>\r\n<p>Do you ever mistakenly print the same document twice? Software can enable duplicate detection and deletion, and print quotas can be set. These defaults are commonly used in settings such as education, where they can be applied to specific user groups. For example, students may be restricted from printing in colour or even have a quota set on how much they can print, whilst staff rules can be much more in line with departmental requirements and budgets.</p>\r\n<ol> </ol>\r\n<h3>Secure or &lsquo;Find-Me&rsquo; printing</h3>\r\n<ol> </ol>\r\n<p>Further savings and process improvements can be made through the use of secure, or &lsquo;Find-Me&rsquo; printing. This technology allows you to print to a virtual print queue. Nothing actually is printed until a user decides to collect their pages. They simply walk up to a device of their choice (this could be on another floor or even in a different building) and logon to the machine using either a PIN, password, proximity card or even finger print. Once logged in, the user can see their print jobs and the associated costs, before they decide to print or delete them. Jobs that haven&rsquo;t been collected after a certain time period can be deleted automatically if required.</p>\r\n<p>This greatly improves document security as it prevents sensitive documents from being left uncollected on printer output trays. Your paper recycling bins will have never been so empty!</p>\r\n<ol> </ol>\r\n<h3>Monitor &amp; Report</h3>\r\n<ol> </ol>\r\n<p>Print control software can put you back in control of your companies&rsquo; expenditure on printing. If you can&rsquo;t analyse it, then you can&rsquo;t manage it. But with an effective print control solution you can use powerful management reporting to challenge user print behaviours. We often find that when users know that their print activity is being monitored, staff behaviour changes. Unnecessary colour printing reduces, more double-sided printing is utilised and the outcome is that costs tumble - it&rsquo;s better for the environment too.</p>\r\n<p>To find out more about how to

(229, 'Printing in a new dimension', '3D printing has really gathered pace in the past few years. We discuss some of the uses devised to take advantage of this technology.', '<p class="introduction">3D printing has really gathered pace in the past few years. From once being in the domain of science fiction, the machines are now available on the high street and resulting in more and more uses being devised for them.</p>\r\n<h2>So, how does it work?</h2>\r\n<p>The 3D printing journey starts with a computer file. A Computer Aided Design (CAD) file is created to tell the printer what pattern to print. The design is sliced by the software into hundreds or thousands of horizontal layers to enable the printer to create it, one layer at a time and from a growing variety of materials including plastics and even edible substances. The object is built up rather than chipping away at a large block, resulting in a more efficient process without waste.</p>\r\n<p>The potential is exciting, here are a few of the most innovative uses that we&rsquo;ve seen yet.</p>\r\n<h2>Commercial design and product development</h2>\r\n<p>Product development can now be done for a fraction of the cost, producing prototypes in a matter of hours. Nike works in this way to create <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/sports/need-a-size-9-nike-and-adidas-can-3d-print-that-for-you-if-youre-an-nfl-player/">multiple, improved prototypes</a> in the space of one day.</p>\r\n<p>Other design-led applications such as architecture have seen a gradual shift from drawings on paper, to CAD models created on a computer and accompanied by models painstakingly built by hand using materials like card and foam. Now a 3D model can be printed to speed and simplify the process.</p>\r\n<h2>3D printing in space</h2>\r\n<p>When an astronaut needed a wrench, the usual practise was a costly one &ndash; to send one up on another craft. Following the development of a 3D printer that works in space, <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/3Dratchet_wrench/">NASA simply emailed a design</a> to the International Space Station - saving a huge amount of time and money.</p>\r\n<p>Medical marvels</p>\r\n<p>From a <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/3d-printed-legs-help-disabled-dog-run-for-the-first-time-225649913.html">dog with 3D printed legs</a> to <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/11202016/3D-printed-drugs-could-revolutionise-prescriptions.html">3D printed medication</a>, the medical industry is one that may be transformed by the technology. Printing a body part to practise on before an operation is becoming increasingly common, and there have already been cases of 3D printed medical implants. For example, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/3d-printing-can-create-replacement-bones-2014-8">replacement vertebrae</a> for a 12 year old boy. Perhaps even more impressively, a tiny splint was created for a <a href="http://www.livescience.com/34613-3d-printing-airway-splint.html">baby&rsquo;s airway to assist breathing</a>; this was designed to grow with the boy over three years, before finally dissolving without a trace as the tissue grows over it.</p>\r\n<h2>Food</h2>\r\n<p>The <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2014/11/06/tech/innovation/foodini-machine-print-food/">Foodini</a> is a 3D printer designed to print food. Currently in its infancy, the device can print complex desserts or foods such as pizza and pasta. It has already prompted ideas about use in the military and for elderly people.</p>\r\n<p>Hershey recently hosted a <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/hershey-chocolate-3d-printer-2014-12">3D chocolate printing exhibit</a> using the printer to produce chocolate shapes. They could design much more complex designs than usual, some even had moving parts!</p>\r\n<h2>What&rsquo;s the future for 3D printing?</h2>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s still early days for the mainstream 3D printer industry but it doesn&rsquo;t seem like it&rsquo;ll be long before the machines are widespread and used for a plethora of applications. Driven by open source communities, more and more complex things are being printed in 3D &ndash; you can even print a 3D printer with a 3D printer.</p>\r\n<p>(Image is the Arena logo printed as a 3D keyring)</p>', '2015-02-16', 'photo (3) edit.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 110782, '2015-02-17 10:29:54', 'The Arena logo printed as a 3D keyring', '2015-02-16 13:59:27', '2015-02-17 16:00:22', 7, 7, 0, NULL, 1, 0, NULL, 'printing-in-a-new-dimension'),
(230, 'Google Vice President Vint Cerf: Print digital files, or risk losing them', 'The Telegraph reported on internet pioneer Vint Cerf’s warning that it is time to start preserving vast quantities of digital data before they are lost forever. ', '<p class="introduction">Speaking at a conference in San Jose, California, Vint Cerf cited a huge problem with our ability to preserve and run software over long periods of time. He said he felt a &lsquo;great burden&rsquo; to find a way to create digital formats which can still be accessed in thousands of years. For now, he advised the printing of treasured photos to ensure they are always to hand.</p>\r\n<p>This leads us to consider legal retention periods for business information &ndash; which sometimes span decades. Printing reams of documentation is not a practical solution and this makes a major issue of the decisions you take around storage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So, what can you do to ensure that those business critical documents you want to store for many years will remain accessible? Here are our top considerations concerning this issue.</p>\r\n<ol> </ol>\r\n<h2>1. Take care if you choose to store &lsquo;hard copy&rsquo; files</h2>\r\n<p>Whenever paper files are moved or handled they are at risk of loss, serious damage or mild degradation. Long-term storage in itself is also a risk - picture dusty yellowed pages held together by rusted paperclips.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Arena&rsquo;s Neil Maude comments; &ldquo;Some types of printed or hard copy documents are particularly sensitive, such as thermal print material, which we''ve seen degrade significantly in as little as 5 years &ndash; and become totally illegible within 10 years.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Carefully plan how you store hard copy documents. We would always recommend an electronic document and records management system (EDRMS) to safeguard your information from damage, degradation and disasters such as floods.</p>\r\n<ol> </ol>\r\n<h2>2. Beware of simply saving files onto a disk</h2>\r\n<ol> </ol>\r\n<p>To reiterate Mr Cerf&rsquo;s good point, it can currently be a challenge to open an AmiPro word processing file, or even a Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet file - both common formats 15 years ago.</p>\r\n<p>Consider file structure - how will you find the file you want, when you want it - and how will you manage the disposal of documents at the end of their retention period?</p>\r\n<p>Add to this the risk of corrupted media and security concerns surrounding the flagging and prevention of file tampering or accidental file deletion and you face quite a challenge.</p>\r\n<ol> </ol>\r\n<h2>3.

Arena’s Head of Professional Services, Ian Fox, takes a look at the reasons why, outlining the rationale and benefits behind biometric authentication technology.', '<p class="introduction">As biometric security becomes more popular, we are seeing increased usage at the point of print. Arena&rsquo;s Head of Professional Services, Ian Fox, takes a look at the reasons why, and offers his top tips for implementation.</p>\r\n<p>An increased focus on document security has resulted in many organisations implementing print control solutions that have Find-Me capable print queues. This technology requires users to submit print jobs to a virtual queue where they are held until the user visits a printer of their choice to authenticate and release the jobs that they wish to print. The security benefit here lies in preventing confidential information from being left uncollected on printer output trays. <a href="../../../articles/putting-the-brakes-on-wasteful-printing" target="_blank">More info here</a>.</p>\r\n<p>There are a number of ways of authenticating (i.e identifying yourself) at the device in order to release your printed pages from the virtual queue. Typically these are PIN, username and password login, or some form of proximity technology such as key fobs or oyster style cards. However, all of these can potentially be lost, stolen or lent &ndash; not so secure.</p>\r\n<h2>Introducing biometrics</h2>\r\n<p>Biometric authentication has become increasingly popular over recent years. The most common device for printers is a fingerprint scanner but other forms exist, including retina and facial scanners.</p>\r\n<p>Unlike a card, PIN or fob, biometric data cannot be lost, lent or stolen - so only users that should have access to their documents can actually release them.</p>\r\n<p>There is also no more danger of forgetting your card or fob &ndash; it&rsquo;s unlikely that users will forget their fingers! Once biometric data is recorded, it is held centrally and cannot be lost.</p>\r\n<p>There are also a cost and efficiency benefits in that the need to buy cards and fobs or to set-up, provide and replace those items is removed.</p>\r\n<h2>Implementing biometric security &ndash; 4 simple steps</h2>\r\n<ol> </ol>\r\n<h3>1. Notify employees of the intention to use a biometric system &ndash; and who they should speak to if they have any concerns.</h3>\r\n<ol> </ol>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting here that change in business is often met with reluctance, especially when that change involves the security of personal data such as fingerprints. For this reason it&rsquo;s wise to try anticipating some likely concerns and queries so that you can be prepared.</p>\r\n<p>For example: Users can be assured that only an encrypted mathematical representation of their fingerprint is stored, rather than an image of their fingerprint. In fact, it&rsquo;s virtually impossible to create an image from the mathematical representation that is stored in the database.</p>\r\n<ol> </ol>\r\n<h3>2. Be prepared for challenges to the system based on any area that is protected by the law - such as religion or disability.</h3>\r\n<ol> </ol>\r\n<p>Consider making allowances and providing alternatives for those who raise any legally justifiable objection to compliance with a biometric scanning policy. There have been cases of employers getting into hot water when challenged by employees who were physically unable to use such devices or who held strong religious objections to using them.</p>\r\n<ol> </ol>\r\n<h3>3. Check current legislation surrounding biometric security, and prepare policies to ensure the safety of all biometric data.</h3>\r\n<ol> </ol> <ol> </ol>\r\n<h3>4. Communicate clearly at every stage of implementation to reassure staff and deal with any concerns as early in the process as possible.</h3>\r\n<ol> </ol>\r\n<h2>The future</h2>\r\n<p>Although it&rsquo;s relatively early days for biometric security in the workplace, it is now accepted and expected in areas such as airports which employ facial recognition software and iris scanners.</p>\r\n<p>There is a huge potential for the use of biometrics in business. If the technology is implemented correctly and accepted, soon you could be clocking in, authorising documents and making purchases all using biometrics.</p>\r\n<h2>For more information:</h2>\r\n<p><a href="../../../articles/join-us-for-our-spring-open-day" target="_blank">Visit us at our next open day </a>to see biometric devices and &lsquo;follow me&rsquo; print technology in action.</p>\r\n<h2>Related articles:</h2>\r\n<p><a href="../../../articles/views-from-the-top-coping-with-change" target="_blank">Views from the top: Managing Change</a></p>\r\n<p><a href="../../../articles/is-your-printer-data-secure" target="_blank">Is your printer data secure?</a></p>\r\n<p><a href="../../../articles/putting-the-brakes-on-wasteful-printing" target="_blank">Putting the brakes on wasteful and unnecessary printing</a></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h3>About Ian Fox</h3>\r\n<p><img src="../../../assets/articles/224/contained_images/93ca34f4a755_276_Ian Fox Jan15 large.jpg?1422352750" border="0" alt="" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="127" height="127" align="LEFT" />Professional Services Manager<br /> Tel: 0800 863 8000 | Email: <a href="mailto:ianF@arenagroup.net">ianF@arenagroup.net</a></p>\r\n<p>Ian Fox joined the Arena Group as a Systems Engineer in 1995.

Do you see any of the following in your organisation:</p>\r\n<ol> </ol> \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Recycle bins overflowing with unclaimed prints</li>\r\n<li>Single side printing</li>\r\n<li>Unnecessary colour printing </li>\r\n<li>Accidental printing of excessive pages </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><br />Create a print policy and raise awareness:</p>\r\n<ol> </ol> \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Print policies can be implemented without the need for user interaction for certain types of document, e.g. set-up printing of emails in mono and double sided. </li>\r\n<li>Alternatively you can inform users about pending print jobs by displaying a popup that details the number of pages, how much colour is being used and even what the cost of the printing the document would be. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ol> </ol>\r\n<p>Communicate:</p>\r\n<ol> </ol> \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Let the business know what you want and how it will benefit them.

(240, 'How do you value your data?', 'The IRMS conference is Europe’s premier event for the records management profession and, whilst much of the content is technical and specific, it’s also a great way to get an overview of trends and themes in information management. Neil Maude shares his thoughts on the event.', '<p class="introduction">In mid-May this year, I spent a very pleasant couple of days at the annual IRMS conference.The IRMS conference is Europe&rsquo;s premier event for the records management profession and, whilst much of the content is technical and specific, it&rsquo;s also a great way to get an overview of trends and themes in information management. These days, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine an organisation which isn&rsquo;t dependent on its information &ndash; in all the forms that may include &ndash; to be successful.  So these themes are relevant for everyone.  Here are some of the key points that I took away from this year&rsquo;s conference.</p>\r\n<h2>Information as Currency</h2>\r\n<p>The stated theme for the conference was &ldquo;information as currency&rdquo;.  To me, this makes perfect sense &ndash; information can be a store of value, in the same way that money is a store of value.  In the same way, it&rsquo;s not much use unless you&rsquo;re actually doing something with it. Several of the conference presentations showed how organisations are unlocking the value of their information, making use of data and not just locking away records as evidence of what happened in the past.</p>\r\n<p>Digitisation of paper records was a common activity to these initiatives, which is unsurprising given that digital information is so much more easily shared around and sharing is clearly a vital step to unlocking value.  But much of our organisational information is still created in paper, for convenience and ease of use.  This paper is expensive to store and share, hence the need for digitisation.  Scanning may also seem to be an expensive process, but the take-away statistic was that it&rsquo;s been cheaper to store information digitally since 1996 &ndash; and the longer you have to store the information, the better it is to have it digital.</p>\r\n<h2>Data is Outliving Systems</h2>\r\n<p>Interestingly, the lifetime of information is typically longer than the usable life of the systems we use to store it.  For example, you may want to store &ndash; or be compelled to store &ndash; a digital document for 25 years.  But the typical life of an electronic document management system is 5 years &ndash; and I can&rsquo;t imagine using an EDMS from 25 years ago!  This mismatch is causing problems for Records and IT managers, who are faced with getting critical information out of obsolete systems and into new ones.  And there were a couple of real scare stories about the cost of doing so, especially in the context of public sector outsource arrangements!</p>\r\n<p>Of course, there is a straightforward solution for this.  When setting up a contract, make sure that your supplier is using open standards and that access to your information is possible.  Ideally, create a decommissioning plan at the outset of a contract, even if only in outline.  That way, you&rsquo;ll know what you&rsquo;re up against when your chosen solution needs replacement.</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s also worth thinking about file formats at this point.  Wide adoption of PDF as a document storage standard &ndash; including the self-contained PDF/A archiving standard &ndash; gives a good method to ensure you&rsquo;ll be able to read a document in a future system.  PDF has always been associated with Adobe Systems, who were the original author.  But Adobe did the world of information management a great service by giving away the rights and now PDF is an ISO standard &ndash; it&rsquo;s not going to change any time soon, it&rsquo;ll be backwards compatible and anyone can use it.</p>\r\n<p>But don&rsquo;t forget about &ldquo;metadata&rdquo; &ndash; the information about the document, such as indexing data or usage history.  It can be very useful to know who created a document, who has looked at it or modified it to a new version &ndash; all of which counts towards legal admissibility, should you need it.  Unfortunately, whilst there are standards for this &ldquo;data about data&rdquo;, they&rsquo;re by no means widely adopted by records management software systems.  According to The National Archives (TNA), most electronic document record management systems are not designed to allow an easy export of data.  But you should still ask how you&rsquo;ll get back your audit trails and indexing data, when you move to a new system.  At Arena, we&rsquo;ve worked on projects where customers had the images from a previous system, but had to re-process all of them to get back to a well-ordered and useable structure (we OCR&rsquo;d the documents for them, recreating the indexes) because the outgoing vendor wouldn&rsquo;t release the index data from the previous system &ndash; an expensive problem that is best avoided at the outset.</p>\r\n<h2>Cloud is Everywhere</h2>\r\n<p>A third recurrent theme was the wide adoption of cloud computing and open source solutions.  I found this striking, given the type of information &ndash; key organisational data &ndash; being discussed.  Jurisdiction remains a crucial concern, however, as it&rsquo;s clearly more appropriate to keep some classes of data with the boundaries of your own network.  However, the increasing adoption of mobile working is an accelerating driver towards cloud computing.  An often-aired view was that the only way to avoid unauthorised use of consumer cloud services, such as free DropBox accounts, is for the organisation to provide a credible alternative.  Credible means usability &ndash; at least as nice to use as the free alternatives &ndash; as well as enterprise-grade security and other technical features.  There&rsquo;s a strong message for IT departments right there!</p>\r\n<p>The risk of open source was also a strong trend, driven by presentation to users via web and mobile &ndash; this move away from desktop computing means that Microsoft is no longer the only game in town.  Examples of this were wide ranging, including Department of Business Innovation and Skill and the US Navy &ndash; both of whom presented their open-source solution programmes at the conference.  Considerable cost savings were a big driver here.</p>\r\n<h2>Value</h2>\r\n<p>This brings me back to a question which I took away from the conference &ndash; just how do you put a value on your information?   A couple of presentations talked about valuing information in line with the investment made in creating the information.  For me, that&rsquo;s going to be misleading, if not plain wrong.  I view that as &ldquo;sunk cost&rdquo; which I can&rsquo;t recover and it&rsquo;s unlikely to be a true reflection of the value I can get from that information in the future.</p>\r\n<p>Some other metrics for information value include the cost to recreate or replace the information if it was lost and the impact of not having it (including potential fines). However, my favourite valuation is to estimate the opportunity value available within that information.  A trivial example is to imagine you have 2 complimentary products, A and B.  You have some customers who have bought one but not the other and you know there&rsquo;s a 50% chance of a purchase if you approach the customer with the additional product &ndash; armed with this knowledge you can easily put a value on your customer purchase records.</p>\r\n<p>But, in the end, it&rsquo;s clear that the value of organisational information is dependent on the context.  Realising that value is going to depend on IT, records managers (or whoever has ownership of the data) and business users all working together constructively.  That too, was a common discussion point throughout the IRMS conference!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>About Neil Maude</h3>\r\n<p><img src="../../../assets/articles/113/contained_images/8d9e8419f6d7_180_NeilM_ws.jpg?1359557446" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" align="left" /></p>\r\n<p>Electronic Document Management General Manager<br />Tel: 0800 863 8000 | Email: <a href="mailto:neilM@arenagroup.net">neilM@arenagroup.net</a></p>\r\n<p>Neil joined the Arena Group in 2006 and has almost 20 years of    experience in the electronic document management industry, working with    both private and public sector customers.&nbsp; Neil sits on Arena&rsquo;s board   of  directors and manages the delivery operations of Arena&rsquo;s EDM   business.&nbsp;  His team spend their time developing software, implementing   solutions  for customers and providing after-sales software support   services, both  in the UK and internationally.</p>', '2015-06-15', 'bigstock-Stacks-Of-Coins-On-Graphs-And-68048935.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 251830, '2015-06-19 10:17:29', '', '2015-06-15 10:13:40', '2015-06-19 10:18:07', 7, 7, 0, NULL, 1, 0, NULL, 'how-do-you-value-your-data');

Even if you have lots of space, you cannot just fill it with documents as you may need to access them for a Freedom of Information request, or destroy them at the end of their retention periods.&nbsp; Managing the different requirements can be very labour intensive.</p>\r\n<p>If you add to this the fact that the FOI act 2000 states that the school must maintain a list of records that have been destroyed, and who authorised their destruction, there is a lot to have covered in your records management policy.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>An alternative solution</strong></p>\r\n<p>Space issues can be addressed by scanning paper files and storing them electronically. Provided you have a system that enables compliance with BS10008 (a standard and code of practice which ensures the evidential weight of documents stored electronically), you can destroy the original paper documents and still have a legally admissible record should you need it.<br /> <br /></p>\r\n<p>A good electronic document and records management system (EDRMS) will apply retention rules to each part of a classification of documents stored in the system. Documents are stored against the appropriate classification (e.g.; attendance, admission, parental permission forms, SEN statements). The system can then apply rules to dispose of documents or present them for review on a set date &ndash;possibly with reference to pupil specific information, such as date of birth.&nbsp; Those documents with a fixed disposal date can be automatically weeded from the files, keeping you compliant with your policies. This approach dramatically reduces the management time associated with retention and completely eliminates the issues associated with large physical paper archives.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For further information on how Electronic Document Management can help ensure your school is compliant, contact Arena Group at <a href="mailto:info@arenagroup.net">info@arenagroup.net</a> or 0344 863 8000.</p>\r\n<h3>About Neil Maude</h3>\r\n<p><img src="../../../assets/articles/113/contained_images/8d9e8419f6d7_180_NeilM_ws.jpg?1359557446" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" align="left" /></p>\r\n<p>Electronic Document Management General Manager<br />Tel: 0800 863 8000 | Email: <a href="mailto:neilM@arenagroup.net">neilM@arenagroup.net</a></p>\r\n<p>Neil joined the Arena Group in 2006 and has almost 20 years of    experience in the electronic document management industry, working with    both private and public sector customers.&nbsp; Neil sits on Arena&rsquo;s board   of  directors and manages the delivery operations of Arena&rsquo;s EDM   business.&nbsp;  His team spend their time developing software, implementing   solutions  for customers and providing after-sales software support   services, both  in the UK and internationally.</p>', '2015-08-26', 'iStock_000015150766Small.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 289546, '2015-08-26 08:39:25', '', '2015-08-26 08:39:26', '2015-09-03 10:28:15', 7, 7, 0, NULL, 1, 0, NULL, 'is-your-school-compliant-with-document-retention-requirements');

The society requires many documents including signed forms, proof of ID and so on. A constant flow of paper passed between branches, head office and the mortgage processing center and all of it had to be matched to the mortgage application file.<strong> m</strong>store automated the process enabling documents to be called-up instantly on-screen by personnel at any LBS branch.

Whilst they were busy managing their office move, it was important that the process didn&rsquo;t impact upon the business.</p>\r\n<p>Fazila commented; &ldquo;Arena prepared us a proposal to scan our paper documents and install <strong>m</strong>store so that we could manage them electronically. The plan they presented made sense and was very easy to understand.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The process we put in place went really smoothly, files were collected by Arena in three batches and scanned. On a few occasions we needed to retrieve a file from Arena urgently and we generally received the document on the same day; Arena&rsquo;s Scanning Bureau team was really helpful.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Fazila explained the benefits that mstore, Arena&rsquo;s software for electronic document management, has had on CBRE&rsquo;s customer service. &ldquo;Before we had <strong>m</strong>store, when a client called we may have had to take their details, search for a file and call them back later, which could take up to 30 minutes.

Rohan George, Head of Property and Procurement, comments; &ldquo;the mobilisation was challenging because Arena had to deliver into individual personal homes. Each site is unique and nothing like a commercial environment, so it demanded flexibility, respect and a degree of sensitivity.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Individual deliveries had to be carefully planned to accommodate each site&rsquo;s needs and timetables; &ldquo;Arena worked out of hours or at short notice to suit us. The installation was completed two weeks early and overall we have had very few complaints about the delivery or the functionality of the devices. That&rsquo;s impressive when you consider the number of sites, distances to travel and numbers of people involved.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<h2>The Challenge</h2>\r\n<p>Community Integrated Care initially reviewed its print and copy strategy to relieve a burden from its workforce. Rohan explains; &ldquo;sites purchased their own printers, scanners, fax machines and consumables. They each had a unique set-up and associated problems so our central IT team were spending most of their time &ndash; literally hundreds of hours - dealing with print and copy issues.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Cost was also a concern; &ldquo;although we are not-for-profit, it&rsquo;s important that we generate surplus income to invest back into our front line services. Print and copy was an area where we could deliver greater control and transparency &ndash; and where we saw a potential for savings.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\r\n<p>Led by Account Manager Michael Wallington, Arena&rsquo;s dedicated Professional Services Team conducted a print audit across a number of Community Integrated Care sites. Rohan comments; &ldquo;they showed such a degree of commitment from our initial meeting. We knew we were dealing with a provider we could trust to deliver a large and complex undertaking. It was clear from the start that Arena had experience of similar large scale deployments and we were impressed by their guarantees on service response times and their first time fix track record. They asked all the right questions and gave us reliable advice - they really can demonstrate an outstanding service reputation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Kyocera multi-function devices (MFDs) were trialled in several sites and received sparkling reviews; &ldquo;in terms of ease of use and functionality they are fantastic.&rdquo; From here, the overall infrastructure was designed; &ldquo;we had detailed and distinct parameters for Arena to adhere to and they adapted the system to work around these for each site.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The removal of old machines was a crucial step; &ldquo;Arena dealt with what might have been a stressful task and that was a weight off my mind. Once our head office installation was done on time and without major issues we felt reassured that we were in for a smooth roll out across the business.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<h3>The final solution encompasses the following elements;</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A new print and copy strategy featuring policies to govern user behaviour, manage output and minimise waste. </li>\r\n<li>New Kyocera MFDs installed at all sites with user training provided.</li>\r\n<li>Arena&rsquo;s Managed Print Service (MPS) to simplify toner supplies, maintenance and billing.</li>\r\n<li>Defaults set on machines to limit colour output, one-sided printing and waste.</li>\r\n<li>&ldquo;Follow Me&rdquo; software on head office MFDs to track output and user activity. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Tangible Results</h2>\r\n<h3><em>A smarter print and copy culture: </em></h3>\r\n<p>Rohan notes; &ldquo;I used to walk through the office and see a stack of uncollected paper on every printer. We&rsquo;ve already made a noticeable improvement and we expect to make significant financial savings just from reduced output.&rdquo; A 20% reduction in colour usage is expected by the end of year one, in addition to around 40,000 pages saved from the recycling bin, which will drive costs down even further.</p>\r\n<h3><em>Increased efficiency: </em></h3>\r\n<p>Rohan cites the introduction of consistent technology across the business as a major advantage; &ldquo;every site has the same device brand and just one machine to print, copy, scan and fax. We no-longer need to worry about separate fax lines - a decision that immediately reduced our costs. Our IT team know exactly what they are dealing with when they get a support call; anything relating to the MFDs will be dealt with by Arena so we can focus on higher priority work.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<h3><em>Simplified management: </em></h3>\r\n<p><em></em>Toner and maintenance are now managed by Arena under a managed print service; &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t have staff at our sites spending time on buying toner or replacing broken machines - they can do the more important and skilled jobs that they are employed for.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<h3><em>Security: &nbsp;&nbsp;</em></h3>\r\n<p><em></em>At headquarters,<em> </em>employees must visit a printer to release their print jobs; &ldquo;it took some getting used to but the &lsquo;Follow Me&rsquo; printing prevents confidential documents from being left on printers.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<h3><em>Transparent costs: </em></h3>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We can report on output and see exactly who is printing what. We get one regular, consolidated invoice so we only need to review our spending annually. This creates fantastic administration efficiencies. We also enjoy the benefit of a long-term partnership with Arena, which means we won&rsquo;t need to review our print and copy strategy again in the near future.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<h2>Next steps</h2>\r\n<p>Rohan makes the point that printing is likely to remain business critical for Community Integrated Care in the long term; &ldquo;CQC requirements dictate that we must keep documents such as Individual Care Plans in hard copy format. We also need fax machines to communicate with GPs and pharmacies.&rdquo; However, the next phase of the document management strategy is an investigation into processes and documents that could potentially be automated and digitised using Arena&rsquo;s <strong>m</strong>store software for electronic document and records management (EDRMS). &ldquo;This would reduce our operating costs further and give our workforce more time to invest at the front line.&rdquo;</p>', 'VJT241013RohanGeorge-004.JPG', 'image/jpeg', 126754, '2013-11-06 11:13:09', 'Rohan George CIC', '2013-11-06 10:40:19', '2014-10-08 11:56:22', 3, NULL, 0, NULL, 1, 6, 66, NULL, 30, NULL, 'community-integrated-care'),

The way we work with paper is a major part of this and the fact that our new machines are carbon neutral through Toshiba&rsquo;s Carbon Zero scheme is very favorable.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Print volume is also expected to fall; &ldquo;I was always binning uncollected pages from our printers and I&rsquo;ve noticed a big reduction.&rdquo; The Trust plans to introduce a clear desk policy, whereby paper left on desks at the end of the week is shredded; &ldquo;this will keep our open plan office looking smart and ensures that sensitive information is safe.&rdquo; Fewer machines also means reduced energy consumption; and defaults that duplex and decolourise pages are expected to deliver further reductions in paper consumption and financial savings.</p>\r\n<p>Simplified toner management has also proven beneficial; &ldquo;the new system is quite convenient because the toner just turns-up when we need it.&rdquo; This has had a positive impact in terms of time and storage space; &ldquo;We used to have cupboards full of toner and nobody was monitoring how much we had in stock. Because the new machines all use the same toner we know there&rsquo;s always at least one spare cartridge around.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Finally, Michael commends Arena on a hassle-free roll-out; &ldquo;considering everything else that was going on with the building move, the installation of the printers was a real blessing, it was all pretty painless.

We also know that  organisations spend between 5 and 15% of their  annual revenue on  document lifecycle costs. 				So, a broader approach that considers the  way you work with  documents across the board will deliver a much more  significant  financial cost saving.</p>\r\n<p>With this in mind, our consultancy service addresses the way your organisation works   with both paper and digital documents with the aim of promoting efficiency,  				reducing waste and minimising costs.</p>\r\n<p>Solutions range from relatively simple ideas that focus on just one  element of your document workflow. 				For example, we may look at  digitising a paper archive or your mailroom.

However, some services may require registration. When you register with us, you may need to complete certain fields (some are required and some are optional), as well as choose a user name and password. In these situations, if you choose to withhold any personal data requested by us, it may not be possible for you to gain access to certain parts of the site and for us to respond to your query. Arena Group process personal data for specific and limited purposes which we inform you about when we ask you for information. For example, we may collect and use personal data to provide you with products or services, to bill you for products and services you request, to market products and services which we think may be if interest to you, or to communicate with you for other purposes. Information you send to our customer service department is used only to help resolve your problem and is otherwise kept private. Arena Group keeps your data only for as long as is reasonably needed for such purposes and in accordance with any applicable legal or ethical reporting or documentation retention requirements.</p>\r\n<h2>3. Non-Disclosure of Information</h2>\r\n<p>Arena Group will not sell, share, or otherwise distribute your personal data to third parties outside the Arena Group group. However, personal data may occasionally be transferred to third parties who act for or on behalf of Arena Group, or in connection with the business of Arena Group, for further processing in accordance with the purpose(s) for which the data were originally collected.

Your consent may always be revoked at a later date. If consent is revoked Arena Group may not be able to carry out certain requests made by you. Arena Group will, where practicable, inform third parties to whom your data have been transferred of your withdrawal of consent.</p>\r\n<h2>4.

At the start, the workforce comprised of six partners, three sales staff and a secretary. Of the original ten employees, six are still part of Arena Group and this low turnover of staff continues today. The Company started with no customers and the first Partners meeting was held in a mobile caravan. During those first few years everyone worked every hour possible and since then the company has grown to encompass 5 sites employing around 120 people.</p>\r\n<p><strong>1993</strong> - Arena achieved Major Account Status with Toshiba. The Systems Division was set up, as the Company worked to expand in a developing area. The use of and possibilities for copiers to be networked to computers became a reality and the Systems Division started selling, installing and servicing networks, computers, and printers.</p>\r\n<p><strong>1994</strong> - The Company achieved ISO9002 registration, which meant that we were achieving consistent high standards of quality on all the work we undertook. In the same year, the Company achieved the status of Investors In People from the Training and Enterprise Council.</p>\r\n<p><strong>1996</strong> - The Company moved its administrative facility to its present location at Armitage House.</p>\r\n<p><strong>1999</strong> - With the acquisition of COS UK Limited, the Company became the largest distributor of Toshiba Copiers and Facsimile Machines in the UK.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2001</strong> &ndash; Arena Group acquired CP Independent.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2003</strong> - Arena Group acquired Sterling Business Systems and WRG Limited.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2005</strong> - Office 21 became part of the Arena Group and then M&amp;S Reprographics Limited based in Bolton, Lancashire came under the Arena umbrella.

From a beautiful rural base on the outskirts of Huddersfield this specialist team have a client base which covers the UK and beyond.

At the start, the workforce comprised of six partners, three sales staff and a secretary. Of the original ten employees, six are still part of Arena Group and this low turnover of staff continues today. The Company started with no customers and the first Partners meeting was held in a mobile caravan. During those first few years everyone worked every hour possible and since then the company has grown to encompass 5 sites employing around 120 people.</p>\r\n<p><strong>1993</strong> - Arena achieved Major Account Status with Toshiba. The Systems Division was set up, as the Company worked to expand in a developing area. The use of and possibilities for copiers to be networked to computers became a reality and the Systems Division started selling, installing and servicing networks, computers, and printers.</p>\r\n<p><strong>1994</strong> - The Company achieved ISO9002 registration, which meant that we were achieving consistent high standards of quality on all the work we undertook. In the same year, the Company achieved the status of Investors In People from the Training and Enterprise Council.</p>\r\n<p><strong>1996</strong> - The Company moved its administrative facility to its present location at Armitage House.</p>\r\n<p><strong>1999</strong> - With the acquisition of COS UK Limited, the Company became the largest distributor of Toshiba Copiers and Facsimile Machines in the UK.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2001</strong> &ndash; Arena Group acquired CP Independent.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2003</strong> - Arena Group acquired Sterling Business Systems and WRG Limited.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2005</strong> - Office 21 became part of the Arena Group and then M&amp;S Reprographics Limited based in Bolton, Lancashire came under the Arena umbrella. This acquisition offered a superb opportunity for the group to develop and grow in the North West of England.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2006</strong> - Mitral Systems Ltd joined Arena Group - one of the leading providers of Workflow, Document Management and bespoke software solutions. From a beautiful rural base on the outskirts of Huddersfield this specialist team have a client base which covers the UK and beyond. The addition of Mitral into the Arena Group family creates the perfect platform for the Company to move away from selling and servicing just photocopiers to the development and implementation of a Company who provide document management solutions.&nbsp;Arena appeared in the Sunday Times 100 Best Small Companies to Work for list and won the National Chamber of Commerce award for Excellence in People Development.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2007</strong> - Launch of CSR community projects with Leeds Ahead and Barnardos.

Integration of supply chain systems and processes alongside fast and accurate communication between multiple stakeholders is key to closing and delivering sales in a timely manner.</p>\r\n<p>The management and storage of documents often represents a cost and efficiency burden for UK motor dealerships, for several reasons;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Stringent legislation surrounding document / data processing, retention, compliance audit and security.</li>\r\n<li>Scarce and costly storage space for paperwork such as deal files.</li>\r\n<li>Dispersed data / documents cannot be shared by multiple people simultaneously, or quickly accessed.</li>\r\n<li>Difficulties in finding documents when responding to enquiries or audits.</li>\r\n<li>Potential crises such as fires and floods present data recovery risks.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The Arena Group has developed&nbsp;<strong>m</strong>store for Motor Dealerships,&nbsp;its own electronic document and records management&nbsp;system (EDRMS). Working alongside your existing dealer management system, <strong>m</strong>store allows you to store, share, reference, move, track and process documents quickly and efficiently in electronic format. This has multiple benefits which all result in cost savings for your business.</p>\r\n<h2>Deal files</h2>\r\n<p>Motor dealerships will enjoy the variety of benefits that <strong>m</strong>store&nbsp; delivers to any business including compliance, collaboration and efficiency. However, for those working with paper-based deal files, there is even more value to be gained.</p>\r\n<p>Paper-based deal files present a particular problem due to their size, complexity and the number of stakeholders required to contribute to them. By its very nature a paper-based deal file can only ever be in one place at one time, presenting difficulties in terms of access for everyone who requires it. Arena&rsquo;s <strong>m</strong>store addresses these problems;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Once scanned into <strong>m</strong>store, original paperwork can be disposed of to address any storage issues.</li>\r\n<li>Documents and data in <strong>m</strong>store can be accessed by multiple people at the same time for a fast and efficient sale process.</li>\r\n<li>Managers can track a deal''s progress, monitor compliance to company  procedures and ensure the required events and documents are coming  together in the right sequence and at the right time.</li>\r\n<li>Individuals required to take action can be  automatically prompted.</li>\r\n<li><strong>m</strong>store integrates with major Dealer Management Systems to populate the <strong>m</strong>store deal file with stock codes, chassis and registration numbers etc.</li>\r\n<li>Access to the digital deal file is available within seconds for an immediate customer service response.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Downloads:</h2>\r\n<p><a href="../../../assets/stored_documents/original/88_ARENA_mstoreMOTOR_DEALERS.pdf" target="_blank">EDRMS in UK Motor Dealerships (PDF)</a></p>\r\n<h2>Further Information:</h2>\r\n<p><a href="../../../page/electronic-document-management">More about <strong>m</strong>store</a></p>', '2013-12-05 14:48:28', '2014-04-15 09:16:40', '', '', 3, 7, 0, NULL, 1, 0),
