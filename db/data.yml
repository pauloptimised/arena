    - New QE liner using Arena technology to test customer satisfaction
    - Arena has installed customer satisfaction software on the new Queen Elizabeth liner. The speedy system was used to help Cunard manage and address any maiden voyage glitches.
    - |-
      <p>The Arena Group designed a bespoke application&nbsp; for Carnival UK, the parent company of Cunard and P&amp;O Cruises, to capture customer opinion quickly and deal with it while passengers are still on board their ships.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The <strong>m</strong>store scanning system &lsquo;reads&rsquo; answers to a detailed customer satisfaction questionnaire, ensuring that no passenger on the luxury liner&rsquo;s maiden voyage leaves the ship with a negative experience.</p>
      <p>Adrian Fitzpatrick, managing director of Arena, said: &ldquo;The speed at which holiday companies respond &ndash; and act - on issues highlighted through customer satisfaction surveys is a critical element for businesses in the highly competitive leisure market.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Carnival UK is renowned for high standards of service and was keen to explore how new technology could help deliver even better results for customers."</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Questionnaires are usually issued at the end of a cruise but our system allows Cunard to ask a &lsquo;floating question&rsquo; at any time on a journey.&nbsp; So if there is a hitch managers can issue a survey during the voyage to evaluate how passengers are feeling and to deal with the situation quickly.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Arena&rsquo;s system replaces a manual process that could take as long as six weeks to complete. A full report&nbsp; is generated in under two hours with the system highlighting items rated as &lsquo;fair&rsquo; or &lsquo;poor&rsquo; and extracting handwritten comments.&nbsp; Staff can hone in on specific service issues, correcting them before the next group of passengers travel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      The Wakefield copier, printer and electronic document management business has five offices employing around 130 people in Yorkshire, Lancashire and the Midlands.&nbsp; In the last few years it has been named a Sunday Times top 100 best small companies to work for and Yorkshire&rsquo;s best company to work for.

    - Print was a bit of a beast
    - Over the summer, more than 120 businesses asked Arena to analyse what they are spending on printers and identify cost savings. Businesses have been shocked at both the number and variety of printers they own - and the cost and time they are wasting.
    - |-
      <ul>
      <li>More than 90% of businesses surveyed had no idea how much they spend on print.</li>
      <li>Schools and businesses were storing old stock for printers that had been thrown out months before.</li>
      <li>Organisations were tying up thousands of pounds in stockpiled toner, &lsquo;in case they ran out.&rsquo;</li>
      <li>One independent school thought they had 39 printers - they actually had 89</li>
      <li>A housing association had so many different makes and model of printer they had to deal with 10 different suppliers for maintenance and consumables.</li>
      </ul>
      <br />Gary Putson, Arena Group sales manager commented: &ldquo;A print audit shows businesses exactly where resources are being wasted. Clients are frequently surprised at the savings made through managed print services - they often ask us to double check the figures are correct!&rdquo;<br /><br />Jaime Lockwood, IT manager at Morrish Solicitors LLP was required to assess print volume and control costs on 20 photocopiers across four different offices. A detailed print audit identified several ways Arena&rsquo;s managed print services could save time and money for the busy law firm.<br /><br />&ldquo;Print was a bit of beast. As well as looking at our existing equipment Arena discussed our future plans and needs and worked with us to get the right option for our business, &ldquo; said Jaime.<br /><br />Now Morrish have a combination of desk top printers, photocopiers and a high volume print room to deal with the heavy print and copy needs of the firm. When a consumable such as toner is running low, Arena automatically sends out a replacement to the designated person.<br /><br />All the new printers employ double sided printing so, in addition to using less paper, the firm are also saving on postage, filing and archiving costs. The new printers are also much faster, so staff do not have to wait to complete their printing tasks.<br /><br />&ldquo;One of the biggest factors in choosing Arena was the efficiency of the printers. We haven&rsquo;t had an error and the machines are greener, faster and more efficient,&rdquo; added Jaime.<br /><br />&ldquo;We always had to store a lot of spares for our printers and we would have one person managing each printer and another storing the toner. The new system has taken out a few layers of administration and management of the printers &ndash; freeing people up to focus on their jobs.&rdquo;<br /><br />Managed Print Services mean:<br /><br />
      <ul>
      <li>Efficiency and reliability of printers</li>
      <li>Cost benefits - savings on energy, printing and less obvious costs such as archiving and staff time</li>
      <li>One single, monthly invoice means costs are transparent and no surprise bills</li>
      <li>Easy to monitor volume of print and spend</li>
      <li>A collaborative approach through understanding the specific needs of each business</li>
      <li>People have more time to spend on their own jobs</li>
      <li>Excellent client service</li>
      </ul>

    - 37 Park Square Chambers
    - Linda Parker is the office manager at 37 Park Square Chambers and explains that their previous computer and IT network system, which was five years old, had 'had its day', crashing and failing its back-ups.
    - |-
      <p>Arena carried out a free IT survey and produced a risk report with recommendations for their requirements, then and in the future.</p>
      <p>Linda says that the process of installing the new network, including two server units, multiple PCs, and cabling, was painless: &ldquo;Arena is very professional - other companies may be a bit cheaper but they can&rsquo;t compete on service. We didn&rsquo;t have any downtime when they installed our new system and there were virtually no teething problems.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Arena has also supplied photocopiers and a document management system, so documents are filed electronically when scanned in.</p>
      <p>Linda says she likes the fact that Arena sends out the same engineers, who get to know their customers. &ldquo;When you get to know people, you aren&rsquo;t frightened of saying &lsquo;I think I&rsquo;m being an idiot, but could you help me on this&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Our business is all about helping and giving advice to our customers, be it individuals or small businesses,&rdquo; explains A4e&rsquo;s purchasing manager, Sandra Shapiro.&nbsp; &ldquo;We need to supply information sheets and documents to take away.&nbsp; Producing this material was costly as we had to outsource work where documents included colour - and not all our staff had access to suitable printers.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Reliability of the machines and service and support were both important when they asked Arena to help them.</p>
      <p>Each office now has a printer which can produce 35 black and white documents per minute as well as password-protected access to colour printing.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;We have two machines in one and it&rsquo;s not expensive as we can monitor the use of colour through the password prompt. We can manage costs by checking what is being printed by whom and when.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>There are very few problems with the machines, but Sandra says that any calls to the engineers are actioned within 8 hours: &ldquo;The engineers are very helpful, even providing training if anyone needs it."</p>

    - Carnival UK
    - Arena's mstore software application is revolutionising how the leisure industry communicates with customers. A bespoke development, designed for Carnival UK, is leading the way.
    - |-
      <p>A speedy system to capture customer opinion for Carnival UK is enabling the cruise company to deal with customers&rsquo; feedback whilst they are still on board ship. &nbsp;Arena installed customer satisfaction software on the new Queen Elizabeth liner.</p>
      <p>Arena&rsquo;s <strong>m</strong>store scanning system &lsquo;reads&rsquo; answers to a detailed customer satisfaction questionnaire, ensuring that no holiday maker leaves the ship with a negative experience.</p>
      <p>The speed at which holiday companies respond, and act, on issues highlighted through customer satisfaction surveys is a critical element for businesses in the highly competitive leisure market.</p>
      <p>Being able to replace a manual turnaround process that could take as long as six weeks to complete has revolutionised the concept of customer service for those travelling and working for the luxury cruise company.</p>
      <p>Carnival UK, the parent company of P&amp;O Cruises and Cunard Line is renowned for high standards of service and was keen to explore how new technology could help deliver even better results for customers, at less cost.</p>
      <p>With a full report generated in less than in two hours, the technology is taking customer service into a new era of sophistication. The system highlights items rated as &lsquo;fair&rsquo; or &lsquo;poor&rsquo; and also extracts handwritten comments, so staff can hone in on specific service issues, correcting them before the next group of passengers travel.</p>
      <p>Richard Parker, Systems Analyst Passenger Services at Carnival UK said being able to link Arena&rsquo;s software to existing multi-function copiers helps the business maximise its existing resources and make significant savings.</p>
      <p>Arena&rsquo;s software, compatible with the ship&rsquo;s existing computer system, allows passenger data to be merged so customer satisfaction questionnaires in the right language are delivered to the correct cabins.&nbsp; On the larger ships this could involve as many as 3, 500 passengers.</p>
      <p>Managers can use comparative studies to monitor across the fleet and ensure great employees are recognised and rewarded and standards are consistent.</p>
      <p>Arena has already created modules to introduce &lsquo;floating questions&rsquo; so that customers can give feedback on themed evenings and entertainment that are route specific.&nbsp; In the long term Carnival UK may widen the scope of the questionnaire to analyse customer demand for specific destinations.</p>

      <p>Arena recently installed some new printers and they are already saving us money. It has cut back on the amount of time and money that was spent on consumables.</p>

As a school we make students aware of green issues and encourage recycling, yet at the end of a week there can be a whole box of unclaimed photocopies by a machine. We are looking at a system that will prevent unwanted copies being printed and not collected.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve gone from one photocopier to a complete document management system from Arena in five years, &ldquo; says Tina McGuffie, office manager. &ldquo;Arena are so amenable and helpful. I give them a problem, they go away and do their research and present me with a solution."</p>
      <p>&ldquo;We will be moving to a new site in a couple of years and merging with three primary schools. Space will be really scarce with no room for archiving so we are aiming for a paperless office using Arena&rsquo;s electronic document management."</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Every letter, every email, every document about a student is now scanned in, including transfer documents from a student&rsquo;s former primary school. It is a really simple system - our admin staff just needed one morning of training on Arena&rsquo;s mstore software. The advantages are we save space and staff no longer have to leave their desks to retrieve files - it&rsquo;s all at their fingertips."</p>
      <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more secure than a filing cabinet - we can lock down the system, giving people permission to view only what they need to see. And every document is backed up so if we had a fire we could retrieve everything."</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Our new school will have a nursery, a primary and a secondary school so we will be dealing with around children aged from 0 to 16.&nbsp; We must have an audit trail of all documents. I decided we should aim for a paperless office in two years so I went to Mike Wallington, my sales contact, and said &lsquo;here&rsquo;s what I want to do, can you do some research for me and let me know what I need&rsquo;."</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Although we&rsquo;ve only had the system for a few months I&rsquo;m already getting great feedback. Admin staff are saving time as they can retrieve files at the click of a mouse and teachers are pleased with the feature that links directly to SIMS."</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Our head of school even wants to look at using the system for his own documents.&rdquo;</p>

    - Leeds Trinity University College
    - Leeds Trinity University College, based on a single campus in Horsforth, Leeds, has approximately 3000 students studying courses from foundation and undergraduate degrees to postgraduate qualifications, with around 400 staff in both academic and support roles.
    - |-
      <p>&ldquo;With the squeeze on higher education budgets all areas of the university college are looking to make savings. On our high volume black and white photocopier alone we produce 1.25 million copies a quarter and our colour copier averages about 30,000 copies per quarter, &ldquo; says Julie Orange, publications service supervisor at Leeds Trinity University College."</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Arena recently installed 21 new multi-function machines across the whole campus linked to the PCs on our network. They help to cut costs because they are more energy efficient and we save on printer toner costs. Staff now print directly from their PCs so desktop printers are being phased out."</p>
      <p>&ldquo;The financial future of higher education is uncertain and the challenge is to continue to provide high quality education and a great student experience within new budgetary constraints. For my team working with a supplier like Arena, who provides cost effective products and an efficient service, is key.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;We selected Arena to supply our photocopiers and multi-function printers thanks to the excellent customer service from their sales representative, Tim Bye. Not only did he offer us the most competitive quote, he has been fantastic in following it up, everything we ask he responds to immediately.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;The after sales service has also been brilliant, and the team at Arena are so easy to contact, either online or by phone.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Leeds Trinity has a carbon management plan that aims to reduce CO2 emissions over five years. It is really important to us that we buy products and services that are energy efficient in line with our goals to be a sustainable campus.&rdquo;</p>

    - Morrish Solicitors LLP
    - Legal firm employing 100 people across four offices in Yorkshire.
    - |-
      <p>As Arena were providing the law firm&rsquo;s photocopiers, Jaime asked them to do an audit with recommendations for providing an efficient and cost effective print service.</p>
      <p>The print audit showed that the firm had 20 printers across its four sites, making it hard to assess volume of print or control costs.&nbsp; Now Morrish have a combination of desk top printers, photocopiers and a high volume print room to deal with the heavy print and copy needs of a busy legal firm. When a consumable such as toner is running low, Arena automatically sends out a replacement to the designated person.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;What impressed me most was that Arena came in and listened to us,&rdquo; explains Jaime. &ldquo;The audit was no tick box exercise. As well as looking at our existing equipment they discussed our future plans and needs. They worked with us to get the right option for our business.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;One of the biggest factors in choosing Arena was the efficiency of the printers. We haven&rsquo;t had an error and the machines are greener, faster and more efficient.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;How we work was also important. All the new printers have duplex (double sided) printing.&nbsp; Not only is this greener because it uses less paper, but it reduces postage, filing and archiving costs. The new printers are fast too so where several people share the same printer they no longer have to queue up for their work.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;We always had to store a lot of spares for our printers and we would have one person managing each printer and another storing the toner. The new system has taken out a few layers of administration and management of the printers - freeing people up to focus on their jobs.</p>

    - Reed Boardall
    - "One of UK\xE2\x80\x99s largest temperature controlled food distributors."
    - |-
      <p>Reed Boardall stores over 6000 different products at their cold distribution centre in Boroughbridge and delivers 175 million cases a year of frozen food to both retail distribution centres and food service depots across the UK.</p>
      <p>In this very fast moving environment, timely information is vital, with different customers requiring individually tailored solutions.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Reed Boardall wanted an information trail that could be accessed by employees internally and give restricted external access to customers over the web. They also needed to reduce paperwork and the need for filing, as well as retain full traceability.</p>
      <p>Arena developed a new process around existing systems, using M-store electronic document management software. This covered everything from the production of delivery notes to the scanning, electronic storage and monitoring of documents.</p>
      <p>Documentation for each delivery is tracked as it goes out and comes back in, using barcodes. On return the documents are scanned in. The system knows what each customer requires and so can flag up anything that is missing. Secure accounts allow customers to view their goods received notes online.</p>
      <p>Reed Boardall has been committed to a &lsquo;green strategy&rsquo; from the early 1990s and the new system is targeted to reduce paper costs by at least 30%.</p>
      <p>Tilburn added: &ldquo;The first stage has been installed seamlessly. I&rsquo;ve been very impressed. We are in control of all our documentation, have improved our processes and greatly improved our service to customers.&rdquo;</p>

    - Insurance brokers for the leisure industry - Nightclub Direct and Millennium Leisure
    - |-
      <p>Governed by the FSA, the Romero Group works in a highly regulated industry. The amount of paperwork that has to be kept for regulatory purposes has increased, leading to an increase in storage and costs as well as being hard to manage.</p>
      <p>There was also no link between customers&rsquo; back up documentation and the specialised software, Agency Manager, used by insurance brokers.</p>
      <p>Arena installed a photocopier, complete with an eCopy ScanStation, which scans customer documentation straight into Romero&rsquo;s specialised software.</p>
      <p>Janice Taylor, Romero&rsquo;s group systems manager, explains how this works:&nbsp; &ldquo;Agency Manager helps our insurance brokers to up sell, renew and cross sell efficiently. The fact that we are able to incorporate customers&rsquo; paperwork into the systems via the link between the copier and the eCopy ScanStation ensures this process runs smoothly&rdquo;.</p>
      <p>Romero is legally required to keep all incoming post relating to insurance business and to have a disaster recovery plan. Miss Taylor says that they can also achieve this with the new copier: &ldquo;Incoming post is now scanned into the system so we have a complete audit trail and the system is backed up regularly, meeting regulatory requirements."</p>
      <p>&ldquo;With the overall improvement to our business processes, our investment will quickly be recovered."</p>
      <p>Service and training has been an important part of putting in the new systems.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;We had a managed print service with another company but the printers weren&rsquo;t reliable and, although service engineers kept coming out, the problems never seemed to be fixed."</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Printers are so important to a school now, particularly for some coursework, we cannot have them out of action. Subjects such as art, digital photography, design and technology have managed time in the classroom for their coursework. It is a real issue if students cannot produce the evidence they need because a printer is not working."</p>

    - |-
      This technology is based around a simple and reliable process. A duplicator first scans the document to be printed, and then digitally reproduces it on a master sheet. This sheet is then wrapped around an ink drum, which turns at high speed whilst paper passes underneath.
      
      By using a drum, a duplicator is able to print at up to 130 copies per minute, even in A3 format, offering a far higher output speed than most conventional office printing technologies.

      "Just a quick line to pass on our thanks and to say how impressed  with the customer service quality we received this afternoon from Kyle  Arnold and John Crookes. They were extremely helpful and patient in  explaining the different functions and capabilities of our relatively  new machine.
      <p>Their experience proved invaluable this afternoon and we would be grateful if this could be recognised in some way."</p>

The five year apprenticeship combines training in the latest technologies with customer care skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Technical support manager John Crookes joined Arena&rsquo;s Apprenticeship programme 10 years ago straight from school after his GCSEs.</p>
      <p>He supports a team of engineers and is still on the road himself.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve grown up at Arena. I joined the apprenticeship programme at 16, not really knowing what I wanted to do. But it was clear that I could progress here and there were good incentives to encourage me."</p>
      <p>&ldquo;The best bit of my job is going out and meeting our customers. It&rsquo;s important to build a relationship with them.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re not simply fixing a machine, but helping a client.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>21-year-old Craig Russell joined Arena&rsquo;s apprenticeship programme just over two years&rsquo; ago.</p>
      &ldquo;We get the very best training, including the chance to learn from big manufacturers such as Toshiba and Kyocera.&nbsp; Being able to work on the very latest machines is a real help with my job.&rdquo;

      <p class="introduction"><strong></strong>At Arena we believe in giving back to our community.&nbsp; Many of our charitable and voluntary activities are focussed on helping children and young people. Some of the ways we help:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Arena is the main sponsor of the Jane Tomlinson Appeal&rsquo;s Junior and Mini Fun Run and pays for the entry fees of every one of the 1,100 youngsters taking part</li>
      <li>Through partnerships with Barnados and Leeds Ahead our employees have helped schools to deliver enterprise projects and cleared up urban areas</li>
      <li>All our employees are given two days a year to get involved with local charities</li>
      <li>Our Bolton office has set a &pound;5000 donation target to help the Big Bolton Fund in its grant provision for community and voluntary groups</li>

      <p class="introduction">Research carried out by Arena shows that print is an unrecognised and often uncontrolled cost in many businesses, organisations, schools and colleges &ndash; and can be a significant headache.</p>
      <p>Arena&rsquo;s free print audits in more than 100 businesses and organisations showed.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>More than <strong>90%</strong> of businesses and schools had no idea how much they spent on print </li>
      <li>One business had more than <strong>25 </strong>different makes and models among their <strong>93 </strong>printers</li>
      <li>A housing association dealing with <strong>10 </strong>different suppliers for printers and consumables </li>
      <li>A school had stockpiled a wall of toners worth almost <strong>&pound;7,000</strong> &lsquo;in case they ran out&rsquo;</li>
      <li>An independent school thought they had <strong>39</strong> printers.&nbsp; In fact they had <strong>89</strong> printers</li>
      <li>Businesses and schools were storing old stock for printers that had been thrown out <strong>12 months</strong> earlier</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>What is Managed Print Services (MPS)?</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>The right mix of printers and copiers to meet&nbsp; your demands and minimise costs</li>
      <li>Software automatically monitors toners &ndash; despatched as needed</li>
      <li>Remote monitoring &ndash; engineers at site often before you know there is a problem</li>

      <p class="introduction">A medium-sized law firm is typically paying between &pound;50k and &pound;100k a year &ndash; or 7% of operating expenses - on annual storage costs.&nbsp; In other professions, such as financial services, increased regulation has lead to increases in storage and costs as well as being hard to manage</p>
      <p><br />Electronically stored documents are now legally admissible and electronic systems highly sophisticated. A thousand boxes in a warehouse can be condensed into the space of a desktop server. And with the increasing use of email, document filing is becoming a haphazard activity in many departments.</p>
      <p>Arena&rsquo;s <strong>m</strong>store software is compatible with industry specific software such as Linetime&rsquo;s case management software Liberate for the legal sector.</p>
      <h2>Some of the issues Arena is solving in the legal sector</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>Links to your case management system for easy indexing and speedy retrieval of documents</li>
      <li>Creation of one single file per set of case documents for third party distribution</li>
      <li>Lost employee hours searching for files, which may be stored off site</li>
      <li>Getting mail quickly in front of fee earners ie for start of business</li>
      <li>Viewing and storing emails using Liberate &ndash; <strong>m</strong>store allows storage of Outlook emails</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="introduction">Arena has been asking a number of existing education clients about the issues they face relating to the management, control and safety of vital documents in their schools and colleges. The biggest single concern was lack of plans in place to protect records and paperwork from fire or flood.</p>
      <p>Some of the problems Arena&rsquo;s <strong>m</strong>store system is solving in education</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Staff CRB checks &ndash; the system records and flags up expiry dates, ensuring all records are up to date for audits, including OFSTED inspections&nbsp; </li>
      <li>Compliance &ndash; a special needs residential school has a system that allows staff to sign documents electronically offsite to comply with reporting incidents within 24 hours </li>
      <li>Security &ndash; records who has viewed information and how often.&nbsp; Different users have different levels of access </li>
      <li>Coursework &ndash; students&rsquo; work is scanned in and saved, protecting it against fire, flood or loss and saving storage space</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>1. Pledge on Privacy</h2>
      <p>The term "personal data" as used in this Policy refers to information such as your name, e-mail address or mailing address, that can be used to identify you. Arena Group will not process your personal data without your consent. In processing your personal data, we pledge to fully comply with internationally recognized standards of privacy protection. In so doing, we ensure compliance by our staff with strict standards of security and confidentiality. The next sections explain how and when we collect personal data from you.</p>
      <h2>2. Intended Use of Personal Data</h2>
      <p>Most of our services do not require any form of registration, allowing you to visit our site without telling us who you are. However, some services may require registration. When you register with us, you may need to complete certain fields (some are required and some are optional), as well as choose a user name and password. In these situations, if you choose to withhold any personal data requested by us, it may not be possible for you to gain access to certain parts of the site and for us to respond to your query. Arena Group process personal data for specific and limited purposes which we inform you about when we ask you for information. For example, we may collect and use personal data to provide you with products or services, to bill you for products and services you request, to market products and services which we think may be if interest to you, or to communicate with you for other purposes. Information you send to our customer service department is used only to help resolve your problem and is otherwise kept private. Arena Group keeps your data only for as long as is reasonably needed for such purposes and in accordance with any applicable legal or ethical reporting or documentation retention requirements.</p>
      <h2>3. Non-Disclosure of Information</h2>
      <p>Arena Group will not sell, share, or otherwise distribute your personal data to third parties outside the Arena Group group. However, personal data may occasionally be transferred to third parties who act for or on behalf of Arena Group, or in connection with the business of Arena Group, for further processing in accordance with the purpose(s) for which the data were originally collected. Where disclosure of personal data to a third party is likely or necessary for whatever reason, Arena Group will, wherever possible, endeavour to ensure that the disclosure and intended use of the data are clearly indicated. Such third parties may operate different privacy policies. However, we endeavour to ensure that such third parties provide the same level of protection as Arena Group and, where appropriate, we will contractually require them to process data transferred only for the purposes expressly authorized by Arena Group. Your consent may always be revoked at a later date. If consent is revoked Arena Group may not be able to carry out certain requests made by you. Arena Group will, where practicable, inform third parties to whom your data have been transferred of your withdrawal of consent.</p>
      <h2>4. Right of Access</h2>
      <p>You have the right to access and update your personal data or to require their deletion. We endeavour to ensure that personal data are up-to-date, accurate, and complete. If you wish to access or correct your personal data held by us, please contact the webmaster. Your requests will be dealt with in a prompt and proper manner. No charge will be levied for complying with a correction request, however, for all other requests Arena Group may charge a small fee to cover its costs. Requests to delete personal data will be subject to any applicable legal and ethical reporting or document filing or retention obligations imposed on Arena Group.</p>
      <h2>5. Security and Confidentiality</h2>
      <p>To ensure the security and confidentiality of personal data that Arena Group collects on-line, Arena Group uses data networks protected, by industry standard firewall and password protection. Access to personal data is restricted to those employees who have a need to use the data and who have been trained to handle such data properly and observe strict standards of confidentiality. If an employee breaches our policies and procedures he/she will be disciplined accordingly. Staff compliance with our policies and procedures is regularly audited and reviewed. While we cannot guarantee against any loss, misuse or alteration to data, we try to prevent such unfortunate occurrences.</p>
      <h2>6. Anonymous Data and "Cookies"</h2>
      <p>Most of the information that Arena Group collects from its website(s) is anonymous information, such as the pages you visit and searches you perform. When you visit our website we do not collect any personal data from you unless otherwise authorized by you. Anonymous information is processed by Arena Group to help improve the contents of the site and to compile aggregate statistics about individuals using our site for internal, market research purposes. In so doing, Arena Group may install "cookies" that collect the first level domain name of the user (e.g., "bigmail.com" from an e-mail address of "john@bigmail.com") and the date and time of access. "Cookies" by themselves cannot be used to discover the identity of the user. A "cookie" is a small piece of information which is sent to your browser and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies do not damage your computer. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a "cookie", this will enable you to decide if you want to accept it or not.</p>
      <h2>7. Spamming</h2>
      <p>Arena Group does not condone "spamming". Spamming is defined as sending unsolicited e-mails, usually of a commercial nature, in large numbers and repeatedly to individuals with whom the sender has had no previous contact or who have declined to receive such communications. In contrast, where Arena Group believes that certain product, or other information is of importance to you it reserves the right to inform you by e-mail whilst giving you the choice of opting out of such service.</p>
      <h2>8. Links to Other Sites</h2>
      <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to Arena Group' websites to the exclusion of third party websites. Arena Group may provide links to other websites which we believe may be of interest to our visitors. We aim to ensure that such websites are of the highest standard. However, due to the nature of the World Wide Web, Arena Group cannot guarantee the standards of every website link it provides or be responsible for the contents of non- Arena Group sites.</p>
      <h2>9. Contact Arena Group</h2>
      <p>If you have any queries or complaints about our compliance with this Privacy Policy, or if you would like to make any recommendations or comments to improve the quality of our Privacy Policy, please contact the webmaster. This privacy policy is effective as of January 1, 2004. We aim to constantly improve the tools available to you to manage the data that you provide to us. Please refer to this page from time to time to review these and other new features.</p>

    - Print Audit 5
    - On a basic level Print Audit can determine the cost of printing within your organisation and any cost savings that could be made by upgrading your printing or photocopying hardware. However, this powerful software is capable of much more than this alone.
    - |-
      <p><strong>Winner of the PBI outstanding print management and cost recovery solution 2006</strong></p>
      <p>Companies large and small are constantly seeking ways to reduce overheads &ndash; premises, staffing levels etc. The one area that seems to be constantly overlooked, despite a massive impact on profitability, is precisely how much routine office copying and printing costs! Every draft, fax, memo, letter or document produced consumes paper, ink, toner and power.</p>
      <p><strong>Do you know just how many documents you produce in a week &ndash; a month or a year?</strong><br /><strong>Do you know how many are in black &amp; white and how many in colour?</strong></p>
      <p>Print Audit 5 provides the essential first step in proving to you how you could save money and reduce your printing costs by finding out:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>How much you are printing</li>
      <li>Where it&rsquo;s being printed</li>
      <li>How the print might be accomplished more effectively</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Print Audit 5 is an extremely powerful but simple to install and configure tool that comprises of three components:</p>
      <p>1. Analysis<br />2. Reduction<br />3. Recovery</p>
      <p>These components are available individually or as a complete package suite.</p>
      <h4>Analysis</h4>
      <p>Most companies underestimate their print costs by as much as 50%</p>
      <p>Print Audit 5 analysis provides an exact picture of current print volumes and cost - learn who is printing what and where through a series of volume analysis reports.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Track print usage discreetly in the background</li>
      <li>Install silently on tens, hundreds or thousands of workstations without any user being aware of the exercise</li>
      <li>Track printer ports, colour information, number of pages and number of copies. It will also automatically distinguish between colour and mono output</li>
      <li>Identify equipment inefficiencies and suggest the most cost efficient print option in your organisation, or perhaps suggest replacement with more efficient and cheaper to run devices</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Reduction</h4>
      <p>Without a print management solution, most companies could find their print costs are running out of control. Typically, document production expenses can be your third highest cost after payroll and premises.</p>
      <p>Print Audit 5 can help control those costs:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Redirect current workload to the most efficient devices and<br />reduce waste and misuse</li>
      <li>Implement print limits for any given user with customisable<br />pop-up messages or bar print by user, device type or colour</li>
      <li>Enforce automatic duplex printing and control colour printing</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There&rsquo;s even a facility that allows you to notify a user of the print job cost before they print to a particular device and suggest lower cost options. That rationale may steer you towards the use of network connected Multifunctional Devices (MFDs) from Toshiba&rsquo;s e-STUDIO range, especially if colour output is required in your office.</p>
      <h4>Recovery</h4>
      <p>Controlling or tracking document production costs is even more vital for organisations that produce chargeable or billable documents. If you are still trying to track and bill for printing or plotting manually, you could be missing out on as much as 80% of your genuine recoverable income.</p>
      <p>Print Audit 5 features:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Optional job code validation and PIN codes with declining balances for chargeable jobs</li>
      <li>It integrates with accounting systems and is designed to work with major CAD packages on the market. Automate every step of the recharging process and never miss or underestimate another billable document ever again</li>
      </ul>

    - They are very good at what they do and how they do it. To be honest, computers are just there to make life easier and you don't want to spend a lot of time thinking about them. Arena has ensured we can just get on with our business and this is all one less worry to think about.

    - Where possible they always send the same engineer - he understands us and he knows the pressure we are under. As a Technology College our print needs are always increasing in volume and complexity and we can't afford to have downtime.  The machines we have from Arena are efficient and reliable but if we do have any problems the engineer is out promptly and repairs the machine quickly. We have Eco School status so it's important to us that our copiers and printers are energy efficient.

    - I used Arena in a previous school and recommended them when I moved here. What impresses me about them is their customer service - they have a completely different approach to other companies.

    - With the squeeze on higher education budgets all areas of the university college are looking to make savings. On our high volume black and white photocopier alone we produce 1.25 million copies a quarter and our colour copier averages about 30,000 copies per quarter.

    - We used to run out of cartridges all the time. Now, thanks to some clever technology installed by Arena, before we have even run out a replacement cartridge arrives with clear installation instructions - so we never have any printer downtime.
