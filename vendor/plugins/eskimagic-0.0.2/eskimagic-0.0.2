09/03/11
--------
Nick - changed site map generator to append / on controllers so they dont give admin routes. This will need to be done for site script generator too.

03/03/11
--------
Nick - removed tinymce.js files from admin_popup layout, it now contains globals which shudnt get redfined by the child popoup window, shudnt matter really tho if you refer to them in problem way (window.parent.global)
Nick - Added a new tinymce popup link to go to the remove link page.

25/02/11
--------
Nick - Changed tree_select to allow a node to be left in its current parent.
Nick - Added toggle fieldset and toggle fieldset control helpers to form helper.

03/02/11
--------
Nick - Added SiteSetting.value("name of setting") method to automatically handle if condition (so if there is no setting which matches the name the method will return "").

26/01/11
--------
Carl - I deleted the AdminTableHelper since it's no longer used.


11/01/11
--------
Adam - Added 'unrecycled' scope to the tag loop in form_helper: object.class.unrecycled.tag_cou... This'll ensure it doesn't draw tags that belong solely to objects in the recycle bin.


04/01/11
--------
Adam - Added Internet Explorer 6 detection and warning message to administration layout.


16/12/10
--------
Nick - admin colours now scan for stylesheets
Nick - tweaked tree_select to not select a disabled option by default.


24/11/10
--------
Nick - changed the page_node can be moved select tag so that souper admins can always move page nodes and so "top level insertion" (...) is on by default.


23/11/10
--------
Nick - improved the bench text file generator to include models referenced in page nodes.
Nick - changed the exception mailer to email the mainteiner with the name of the site in it.


18/11/10
--------
Nick - added a new helper: number helper, at the moment just has the number_to_pounds method but this is where we will dump all other number methods.
Nick - added quick_fill_tag to form helper in eskimagic.  This inserts a select box which prefils a target element.  e.g. quick_fill_tag("product_colour", Product.all.collect{|x| x.colour}.uniq.sort, name="Similar Colours...") will fill the products colour with the colour the person selects from the drop down menu, which will be full of other colours which products use.  
Carl - Removed html_popups routes from config/routes. Also sorted out the rest of the routes so the fallback catch-all routes we usually have should be unnescessary. So I commented them out.

15/11/10
--------
Nick - small changes, made the tree select check that the items in it havn't been recycled (mostly for page notes, position select).  Also changed the default data so the feature "Recycle Bin" goes to the controller "admin/extra_infos" to stop a problem with routes.


11/11/10
--------
Nick - Turned off error messages by default since they are sometimes getting to the client, we are so overloaded with them that it makes it impossible to check.  We can turn them on when we need to if we have a known issue on a site or just plain do want it on.
Nick - Fixed a bug in eskimagic where the creator and updater werent getting set.  Also change the index_list_advanced to list the creator and updater properly and removed delete page links from index_list and index_list_advanced.


10/11/10
--------
Nick - Tiny change on the eskimo_scaffold so that the name of the feature generated by running the scaffold is .titlized instead of .humanized.


9/11/10
-------
Carl - check_box_tree_tag is now orderable by position.


05/11/10
--------
Carl - Added check_box_tree_tag to the form builder extension in eskimagic. The partial it uses is in admin/shared.


27/10/10
--------
Nick - Moved tasks from eskimagic, eskimo_images and yaml_db to lib folder to remove warning
Nick - Added code to automatically format dates and date times in the admin tables
Nick - Moved the paperclip tasks to lib/tasks to force them to work, this is a bad approach and needs to be addressed


21/10/10
--------
Carl - Added quite a few routes to the standard, eskimodules and eskimages route files.
