Follow these steps to get documents to work as they should;
	
  delete eskimo_documents-0.0.1 from vendor/plugins folder
  copy over eskimo_documents-0.0.2 from framework
  
  for each Model using documents add "handles_documents_for Model" in the relevant controller
  and also "may_contain_documents :attribute" in the relevant model.
	
  copy over public/images/admin/document_manager.gif from framework. This is not the right image yet
  but hannah has been tasked and i will give people a shout when it's done.
  
  copy over vendor/plugins/eskimagic/app/views/admin/html_popups/index_links.html.erb
  -- this will remove the option of the old way of handling documents.
  
  copy over vendor/plugins/eskimagic/app/views/layouts/admin
  -- this points tiny_mce to the right controller
  
  copy over public/javascripts/admin/tiny_mce_configs.js
