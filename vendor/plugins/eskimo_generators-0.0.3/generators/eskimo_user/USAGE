Description:
    Generates a eskimo_scaffold template which behaves as a standard "Users" module.  Quickest way to start using on the front end is to add the _navigation partial to the layout.  Because this uses emails to reset passwords ensure you have the sites default url set in the configs properly.  
    
Examples:
    ./script/generate eskimo_user SingularObjectName
    ./script/generate eskimo_user User
    ./script/generate eskimo_user Customer
    ./script/generate eskimo_user TeamMember
