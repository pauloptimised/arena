24/11/10

11/11/20
--------
Nick - Added ability to give different display names to images and styles.  At the moment these new names are shown on the index_images page and the form.  It will look for the alternate name and if it cannot find it will fall back to the name of the attachtment.  To give an image a different name just add a contant to the model with the name of the image followed by '_name' (Image_name = "Main Image") for example.  To do this for a style use Image_style_name (Image_2_large_version_name = "Show Page Version").  This is documented in the README.
