eskimo-redirects
================

This plugin is straightforward and can be used with any eskimodules version by dropping it in and navigating
to admin/redirects. If adding it to an older site make sure you also create a feature so that it appears in
the navigation and set the permissions to souper user only. For new sites this should already be done.

You will need to restart apache to apply changes
